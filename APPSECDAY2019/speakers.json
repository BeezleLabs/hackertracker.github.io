For the past three years errbufferoverfl has been using the mystical powers handed down for generations to write Python code and consult on security dark arts. She specialises in divination via web applications and calling upon the clouds to tell their dark secrets. She has strong opinions about client-side validation and how CSRF tokens should be handled. When she isn't testing web applications, writing code and zines you can find her in her garden tending to her poisonous plants and terrariums. Like all good cyber witches if unattended too long she will start divination by your laptop.",
