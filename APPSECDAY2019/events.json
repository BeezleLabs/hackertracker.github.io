      "description": "With Organizations rapidly moving towards micro-service style architecture for their applications, container technology seem to be taking over at a rapid rate. Leading container technologies like Docker have risen in popularity and have been widely used because they have helped package and deploy consistent-state applications. Orchestration technologies like Kubernetes help scale such deployments to a massive scale which can potentially increase the overall attack-surface to a massive extent, if security is not given the attention required.\n\nSecurity continues to remain a key challenge that both Organizations and Security practitioners face with container orchestrated deployments. While container orchestrated deployments may be vulnerable to security threats that plague any typical application deployments, they face specific security threats related to the containerization daemon, shared kernel, shared resources, secret management, insecure configurations, role management issues and many more! Attacking an infrastructure or Applications leveraging container technology requires specific skill-set and a deep understanding of the underlying architecture.",

However, incorporating robust and resilient application security practices within a continuous delivery pipeline can be challenging.\n\nTo compound these challenges, application security and engineering teams grapple with a host of capacity issues. From a more reactive model, where security assurance was done periodically, and in bursts, we now have to embed application security practices throughout an organization\u2019s product development life cycle. This has resulted in teams being stretched in multiple directions, and unable to cope with the ever increasing demands. While your product may be delivered to your customers faster, application security still remains difficult to integrate within your continuous delivery environment.\n\nThis training addresses these challenges and more, and is focused towards enabling and delivering application security at scale to organizations. This is a largely hands-on program, with a plethora of anecdotes, examples and real-world case studies. This gives the participants a comprehensive view of implementing practical DevSecOps and application security automation practices within their organizations. In fact, most of the participants have reported that they were able to use learnings from this training almost immediately.",

We must build security into each of \u201cThe Three Ways\u201d; automating and/or improving efficiency of all security activities to ensure we don\u2019t slow down developers, speeding up feedback loops for security related activities so that we fix the bugs faster and sooner, and providing continuous learning opportunities in relation to security, for both teams. Security can no longer be a gate or stumbling block, and \u2018adding security in\u2019 can no longer be used as a justification for project delays.

It is common knowledge that when bringing up cloud computing resources you should implement controls such as preventing SSH logins as the root user, disabling password authentication for all users, and limiting which IP addresses can talk to the different services on your virtual machines, as well as requiring multifactor authentication for employees accessing cloud control panels. You can be fairly certain that an alarm would go off if an attacker was able to gain access, and that their access would be limited. But what happens if an attacker takes a different path and your infrastructure provider is compromised instead? Are your systems protected from that vector, and will your heuristics catch it? In this talk, we will tell a story, not from Netflix, but from the not too distant past around a successful targeted attack against a company using infrastructure providers as the vector. Details surrounding the methods used by the attacker will be shared, including the steps they took to attempt to cover their tracks. We will also look at how the attackers attempted to regain access after the initial vector was closed. Finally, we will look at what steps you can take to help mitigate the risks you incur if your infrastructure provider is compromised.",

      "description": "Let\u2019s face it, performing a manual review of someone else\u2019s source code is hard. It takes time, effort, expertise, and grit to actually figure out what the application does, how the developer implemented it, and if there should be any changes. From an application security perspective, this becomes even more difficult because of the security nuances of multiple languages that must be understood in order to identify and squash vulnerabilities. On top of that, most security reviews must be performed within a limited amount of time against more lines of code than recommended in standard code review best practices. After performing secure code reviews for over a decade, it becomes easier to identify a pattern and framework to address security concerns within code quickly and efficiently. This talk will introduce the Absolute AppSec Secure Code Review Framework to attendees and discuss lessons learned, code review tips and tricks, and strategies for quickly assessing code that can be used by reviewers immediately.",

Even the best-intentioned engineers may define insecure configurations which lead to critical misconfigurations in production.\n\nAt Cruise, we use Kubernetes for a multi-tenant Platform as a Service (PaaS). One of the hardest things to get right was effective tenant isolation in a mulit-tenant container environment.\n\nFor attackers: this combination of freedom-without-guardrails potentially exposes workloads and clusters to issues such as pulling assets from untrusted sources, accidental public exposure, elevated privileges, etc. We provide cases when this has gone wrong (i.e. known vulnerabilities), and walk through how to exploit them. For attackers, this is a pwning k8s 101 talk, no dropping 0dayz here.\n\nFor defenders: we wrote a tool to prevent this. K-rail is a tool for workload policy monitoring and enforcement in Kubernetes that enables you to safely lock down your cluster while maintaining high developer productivity. During this talk we will open source this tool, and share some common policies from lessons learned of running this in production at Cruise.\n\nNo matter what colour hat you wear, you'll come away from the talk with an understanding of what kinds of security issues commonly arise within k8s environments, some effective policies to deploy in your environment, how to deploy them, and a new tool for doing so.",

      "description": "Today, a huge portion of our data lives in web applications, often in multitenant, high-exposure environments. Yet despite this centralization of valuable information, the diversity of application platforms has made responding to incidents in the webapp layer difficult. This lack of standardization in combination with a traditional focus on the systems side of incident response means that many security teams do not have the tools to effectively analyze attacks on their web applications. Web application incidents have gotten even harder to handle in the last few years: complex architectures and custom components mean that without special preparation, defenders may be left to decipher a heap of low-signal logs to determine what happened. The processes for investigating an application security flaw also tend to diverge from traditional incident response, since attacker behavior is significantly different. Heightened scrutiny of breaches due to new regulations has led to even greater pressure on responders to quickly understand the scope of an event. This talk introduces a flexible framework of technologies, tools, and procedures that has been essential to responding to threats to a major modern web platform. This provides a system to evaluate the capabilities currently in place to handle appsec incidents and plan new efforts to help security teams confidently investigate and respond to attackers on the web.",

All this while still maintaining control of the infrastructure, protecting users from each other and monitoring all activities performed within our network. The resulting scenario is literally one of \"assumed breach\" where we must ensure that the \"attackers\" who have access to these insecure machines cannot cause any further havoc beyond this scope. To accomplish this, we have built our systems from the ground up, leveraging entirely open source technologies such as Docker and KVM. Lots of lessons were learned and many things were done in unconventional ways to secure this infrastructure.

      "description": "Serverless Technology (Functions as a Service) is fast becoming the next \"big thing\" in the world of distributed applications. Especially with widespread support from cloud vendors, this technology is going to only become more influential. However, like everything else, Serverless apps are subject to a a wide variety of attack possibilities, ranging from attacks against access control tech like Function Event Injection, JWTs, to NoSQL Injection, to exploits against the apps themselves (deserialization, etc) escalating privileges to other cloud components. GraphQL (API Query Language) is the natural companion to serverless apps, where traditional REST APIs are replaced with GraphQL to provide greater flexibility, greater query parameterization and speed. GraphQL is slowly negating the need for REST APIs from being developed. The convergence of serverless functions and graphic provides attackers with some unique attack possibilities that can lead to lateral movement across Cloud APIs or financial attacks (DoS) that can literally run organizations out of business This talk presents a red-team perspective of the various ways in which testers can discover and exploit serverless and/or GraphQL driven applications to compromise sensitive information, and gain a deeper foothold into database services, IAM services and other cloud components. The talk also features real-world serverless and graphql implementations, specifically to highlight the lack of frameworks, tooling and security mechanisms that makes life much harder for developers to implement, therefore, easier for attackers to compromise",
