While some aspects of technology are fairly well understood and accepted in court, there are many flaws in the approaches to date, and worse, there is much that goes completely unaddressed in courts throughout the country. A review of the process flow with legal actions in civil matters, evidence components, strategies and tactics, and an overview of how expert consulting and advising works is provided in the hopes that more courts can be made aware of the concerns and personnel will provide their expertise to improve legal outcomes and improve fairness and equality in legal proceedings. Listeners will come away with a better understanding of how civil court evidence works (from Liticode's perspective) and potentially be able to capitalize on the knowledge to obtain paid consulting work nationwide.",

Specifically, you will use OpenSCAP to scan and remediate against vulnerabilities and configuration security baselines. You will then block possible attacks from vulnerabilities using Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and use Network Bound Disk Encryption to securely decrypt your encrypted boot volumes unattended. You will also use USBGuard to implement basic whitelisting and blacklisting to define which USB devices are and are not authorized and how a USB device may interact with your system. You will also learn how to deploy opportunistic IPsec to encrypt all host to host communication within an enterprise network.\r\n\r\nThroughout your investigation of the security issues in your systems, you will utilize the improved audit logs and learn how to use the Audit Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE). You will also learn how to create a single sign-on environment for all your linux servers using Red Hat Identity Management and learn about GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) which can be used to identify yourself and encrypt your communications. You will also have a chance to learn how to use firewalld to dynamically manage firewall rules. Finally, you will make multiple configuration changes to your systems across different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux running in your environment, in an automated fashion using Red Hat Ansible Automation, using the Systems Roles feature.\r\n\r\nIf you want to participate in the hands on lab, please be sure to bring a laptop to the event with a SSH client and web browser (Firefox with plugins disabled recommended).",

However, there is one thing most infosec professionals will agree on\u2026 and that is the fact that we all run around like our hair is on fire because we don't have enough resources to accomplish everything that needs to get done. I know this is the case for most infosec people I talk to. Even if we get an additional headcount, our list of compliance checkboxes, projects, and daily responsibilities keep growing at a phenomenal pace. How do we keep up with this fast-paced growth, insane workload, alerts out our ears and no end in sight? One of the best ways to make a big impact is through automation. Whether you have a massive budget or no budget at all, I will discuss your options and how to start the automation journey\u2026 or improve upon what you already have. I'll talk about using existing tools, creating your own scripts, using API's and even the latest fad in security automation, SOAR (security operations analytics and reporting). We will discuss how to determine what you should automate first, automation use cases in infosec, and how to tell if there\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t automate. Let's face it, we are over tooled and understaffed\u2026 We need automation to help us out.",

      "description": "This talk provides an overview of the development and usage of the Cyber Security Simulation Portal (CSSP), a web application built on the Ruby on Rails framework which provides a portal to manage cybersecurity simulations in the cloud. The objective of this effort was to create easy-to-build, easy-to-destroy environments which users can access remotely. Such environments can be useful in training exercises for competitions such as the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. By utlizing cloud computing and APIs, training resources can be allocated on demand which can greatly reduce costs of setup, deployment, delegation, and usage.",

      "description": "It's awesome when we have a nice datacenter with oodles of compute, network, and storage. Most of us can't quite front the cost for that home datacenter, so we have to figure out the best way to build infrastructure to secure or break. This class will explore infrastructure automation in the home using modern tools including QEMU/KVM, Packer, Vagrant, Zerotier, and OpenVSwitch. If we have reasonable internet access, we will also experience cloud bursting to understand how that can provide on-demand compute without the expense of 24/7 operations. Students will create both CentOS and Windows VM's in an automated build process from ISO and learn how to deploy them via Vagrant.\n\nThey will experiment with OpenVSwitch and Zerotier to get exposure to VXLan and software defined networking that will allow VM's running on disparate hypervisors that ability to communicate as though they were connected on a local network. Finally, they will be exposed to Google Cloud and Packet.net to understand two different cloud approaches (service and baremetal) to understand how remote hosting can help provide extensive compute resources on demand without spending hundreds of dollars.",

      "description": "This talk is designed to provide you the skills necessary to hunt for malicious actors on the networks you defend. I will teach you how to do this using primarily Open-Source software and technologies. You CAN have effective cybersecurity on a limited budget.\n\nPart 1: OSINT Network defenses - talk through creating an open-source network intrusion detection sensor leveraging a Raspberri Pi and Suricata. We have successfully deployed these sensors on network up to 500 endpoints. We will cover the basics of what Suricata is as well as how to use a Pi for better visibility within a network.\n\nPart 2: OSINT Threat Intel - talk through using a number of different tools for faster false positive detection. Will also speak about how to automate some of the OSINT feeds for the Suricata sensor - daily OSINT updates protecting the network.\n\nPart 3: Now that we have some tooling in place - how do we look for anomalous activity. Will cover how to approach an investigation, define attackers and define a compromise.\n\nPart 4: Introduction of our F3EA Framework for threat hunting. Explore all 5 sections and define what each are and how they relate to the overall investigation. The Framework is iterative and feeds itself.\n\nPart 5: Threat Hunting models - practical examples of how to hunt and a number of common techniques that we have found highly successful.",

The entire goal of a domain/website is to make it easy for potential customers or partners to find the information they want easily. Unfortunately, this also sets up the owner to release too much information about themselves.\n\nThe goal of this talk is to show what information we can collect and expand on given a single domain name. We will answer the question of just how far we can go down the information security rabbit hole with just a single data point. We will only take advantage of open source services and tools, though we may discuss how other paid services and tools could aid to dig the hole even deeper.\n\nIf we can get this far and this much data during this short talk, how far do you think a threat actor can get when he/she devotes his/her entire motivation and attention to it?",

      "description": "The term \"Left of Boom\" was made popular in 2007 in reference to the U.S. military combating improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used by insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. military spent billions of dollars developing technology and tactics to prevent and detect IEDs before detonation, with a goal of disrupting the bomb chain. This is an analog to cybersecurity as we strive to increase the incident prevention capabilities of our security tools and where we can\u2019t prevent attacks, augment prevention with incident detection and response tools.\n\nIf you feel that you don\u2019t have the cybersecurity evidence to know, empirically, what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, how to fix it, how to verify the fix worked, and how to make sure it stays working across your security tools, your people, and the processes they follow, this presentation is for you.\n\nThis presentation will demonstrate automated methods to mitigate these problems. It will identify approaches that you can apply to improve the effectiveness of your security tools, security teams, and processes. Following this presentation, you\u2019ll be able to develop your own strategy to get \"left of boom.\"",
