Is it a data center environment located in the United States or anywhere in the world? Is it really just \u201csomeone else\u2019s computer\u201d? Or, is there more to it that needs to be understood by the Information Security professional, to arm him or her with enough knowledge to answer the tough question that inevitably will be asked by their employer, \u201cWhy should we take the risk to move our most sensitive data into the cloud?\u201d To take it one step further, should in the event of a data breach that same employer should say, \u201cWe need to investigate how this happened;\u201d what exactly will the Information Security professional need to know to successfully conduct a digital forensic investigation, especially if he or she doesn\u2019t have direct access to the server or hardware?\r\n The Cloud Forensics Challenge team (@Cloud4n6) is excited to come to the BSides NoVA conference for 2019 and bring our workshop with us. We have presented this training at both the 2017 BSides DC and the 2018 BSides Charm events, and seats have sold out both times. The focus of our workshop is two-fold: first, to explore key concepts of Cloud computing and understanding the procedures and processes of conducting a digital forensics investigation in the Cloud; and second, a half-day challenge to test students' comprehension of the material and their skill sets by investigating a digital image of a Cloud-based server and searching for various 'flags' to be turned in as part of a team competition. Prizes will be up for grabs and we look forward to sharing our knowledge with attendees!\r\n What to expect: Everything including the kitchen sink. Come get a 10,000-foot view on cloud computing and how it changes the way a digital forensics investigation is conducted. Come test your skills and knowledge on log analysis, file carving, packet analysis, memory analysis, reverse engineering, steganography, cryptography, and other areas as you conduct your investigation accordingly.\r\n What to bring: A laptop capable of running the latest version of Kali Linux. Don't like it nor care for it? Have the following tools pre-loaded and ready to go:\r\nTSK/Autopsy\r\nWireshark\r\nVolatility or other memory forensics software\r\nOpenStego or other steganography software\r\nIda Pro (trial version is fine), Ollydbg, or other reverse engineering tool\r\nDecrypter or other decryption software\r\nCipher tools",

      "description": "Does malware analysis seem like an arcane process involving hours of staring at assembly in OllyDbg or IDA? Is the only alternative relying on an 'auto-magically' generated report from a sandbox? Many of the malware variants that today's analyst will face during incident response, however, are not compiled binaries like Windows PE files, and do not require a knowledge of assembly to manually analyze. The goal of our training is to equip frontline defenders, regardless of job title, with skills to begin more advanced analysis of common malware variants, and help them avoid over-reliance on automated tools that may be defeated by anti-forensics.\r\nWe will present techniques for analyzing obfuscated VBA/VBS downloader scripts embedded in phishing email attachments. We will demystify malicious PowerShell being used for post-exploitation activities. We will also discuss JavaScript drive-bys and how an adversary can try to regain a foothold via a PHP tiny webshell. This training is for anyone on a blue team without a dedicated malware analyst, or anyone interested in malware analysis, but intimidated by all that hex.",

In the past, we have worked on getting users to plug in USB devices to drop malicious documents and executables. While this attack sometimes proves our point, it is the tip of the iceberg that can be done. Enter Social Forensication. This is a two-pronged attack, consisting first of collecting a memory image for offsite offensive forensic analysis, the second being a rogue Wi-Fi access point attack. During this presentation, we will walk through the steps to perform each attack.

      "description": "Military organizations have long known of the value of intelligence, but many commercial entities only realized its importance in the last five years. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) recently became a priority for the average commercial company who now requires a threat intelligence analysis capability. Are you a security-geek like Jason Wonn who was recently hired to provide that world-class CTI program for your company with very little time and an even smaller budget? \u2026Good luck with that! Jason cannot present that solution in an hour, but he will guide you through the process to evaluate a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) and discuss how he made the metrics meaningful to the executives. In this original research talk, discover the benefits of employing a TIP and the technical evaluation of a TIP through requirements development to ensure it is measurable and meaningful to your leadership. If you're in the market for a TIP, don't miss this presentation from a customer's point-of-view using over 100 measurable requirements!",

      "description": "By popular request, this is a sequel to a 2017 talk entitled 'Engineering Challenges Doing Intrusion Detection in the Cloud.' Security teams often ask for 'network intrusion detection' but conventional, specification-based intrusion detection paradigms, particularly around network intrusion detection, are not easily applied to the software defined network abstractions that power multi-tenant public clouds. The 2017 talk was about the experience of doing intrusion detection at scale at one of the ten largest AWS environments at the time. One of the major lessons learned during this time is that in the public cloud, where direct network instrumentation is unavailable, doing behavioral detection with endpoint data is often more effective and more efficient. Mandating the installation of terrestrial network security products onto software defined networks of the sort utilized in public clouds is not always the most productive approach.\r\nThis talk presents a practical demonstration of doing behavioral intrusion detection, threat hunting and security analytics using free and open source tools. Most security analytics use cases including compliance monitoring, behavioral and specification based intrusion detection, database monitoring, data loss detection, machine learning, security analytics and threat hunting can be accomplished through the coordinated usage of open source tools. This approach avoids numerous pitfalls facing security teams today such as managing fleets of complex and expensive security agents and operating metered data analytics platforms whose bills force difficult decisions about which data to ingest. Another, and perhaps the most compelling, advantage of the open source approach is the freedom to engage in community driven development and sharing of searches and analytics, which is sometimes missing in the black-box security product space.

      "description": "Analytic conception of 'false flag' tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) employed as part of sustained intrusion campaigns has primarily been presented in narrowly technical and tactical terms within the cyber threat intelligence community of practice. This discussion to date has been atheoretic, divorced from the wider professionalized understanding of denial & deception (D&D) doctrine and praxis that has developed over decades of intelligence community experience against hard target problems. As a result, analysis based on the dominant conception is often implicitly flawed by unacknowledged cognitive defects and other sources of error. It is necessary to challenge this conception and to reconsider the hitherto unexamined assumptions of 'false flag' operations in order to improve analysis, targeting, and collection against intrusion sets which have sought to complicate attribution, or to introduce deliberate misattribution narratives through deception measures.\r\nThis talk will present a target-centric model of hostile D&D activity considered as operational art within the context of adversary capabilities generation and deployment, campaign sustainment, disruptive and destructive effects delivery, and intrusion termination. We will examine the role of the operations planner in offensive activities, and the influences of foreign military and intelligence traditions on this function. Case examples will be explored in order to assess preliminary model validation, and to estimate future developments in adversary tradecraft. These future adaptions are expected to present new challenges of particular importance for analysts and defenders in the near to mid-term, as increasing operational pressures on adversary operators may be anticipated following the declared intention of the US government to shift towards 'defending forward' through the employment of deliberate counter-cyber operations to deny and degrade hostile capabilities options.",
