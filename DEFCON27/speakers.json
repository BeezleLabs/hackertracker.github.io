Bramwell is the creator of the the JOP ROCKET, or the Jump-oriented Programming Reversing Open Cyber Knowledge Expert Tool. Bramwell has been interested in code-reuse attacks for several years. Bramwell was overcome by the urge to present a tool that made JOP more practical and useful for hackers who may wish to attempt using this more arcane class of code-reuse attacks. The JOP ROCKET is a by product of his doctoral dissertation.",

He has had extensive experience with heterogeneous technologies and computer architectures. Over his years of professional work experience, computer security has long been his passion - whether it has been around designing exploit prevention capabilities of an endpoint security solution, or doing vulnerability research on carrier-grade telco charging software, or analyzing an exploit/malware to create a detection signature, or just participating on CTFs for fun. Marcos is currently working at McAfee as a Software Architect, leading the development of the exploit-prevention technology components which are part of the company's next-generation flagship product called Endpoint Security (ENS). This product is currently deployed over millions of endpoints worldwide. Marcos also led the organization of the first-ever BSides conference in Cordoba, Argentina.",

He has built, assessed, and managed security teams at the Pentagon, the White House, the Department of Energy, global Managed Security Service Providers, and numerous financial sector and Fortune 500 clients. Short on patience and attention, Mark is constantly working on new projects to improve defensive security through automation and other short cut-y things so defenders can be more agile and creative. While Director of Operations at Foreground Security, he designed and launched a Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service offering and helped to invent an automated cyber threat hunting technology, both of which were later acquired. He enjoys teaching and learning from others but spends far more time doing the latter.\r\n\r\n",
