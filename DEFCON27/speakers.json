His understanding of security naturally flowered into a deep passion for privacy and he slowly found himself following journalists uncovering the state of surveillance in the United States. In early 2016, he experienced a drastic change of world view when he abandoned the orthodox Mormon belief system he was raised with. Despite having left the religion, Ethan has found the culture of Mormonism to be important to his identity. He continues studying the religious movement's history and progression as a secular Mormon. In late 2016, he was a founding member of the MormonLeaks.io team where his loves of transparency and Mormonism intersected. A year later, he co-founded the Truth & Transparency Foundation, a non-profit newsroom dedicated to empowering the disenfranchised by promoting transparency within religious institutions. He holds a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Utah Valley University and enjoys learning and writing about where his interests of technology, security, privacy, and religion intersect.",

In an odd turn of events, Adam found that all this security compliance made him level-up his systems engineering game. After satisfying a number of security \"one-offs\", Adam started to realize where non-engineers had strengths and willingness to bolster his program's overall security. As a lonely security engineer in a feature-driven world he credits the infosec community for providing so much \"professional development\". He is happy to show engineers how fun (less painful?) security can be. Tragically, he has yet to meet anyone who can wrestle failed vuln scanners as well as he can - but he knows that special someone is out there.",
