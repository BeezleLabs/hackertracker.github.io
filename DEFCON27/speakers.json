His understanding of security naturally flowered into a deep passion for privacy and he slowly found himself following journalists uncovering the state of surveillance in the United States. In early 2016, he experienced a drastic change of world view when he abandoned the orthodox Mormon belief system he was raised with. Despite having left the religion, Ethan has found the culture of Mormonism to be important to his identity. He continues studying the religious movement's history and progression as a secular Mormon. In late 2016, he was a founding member of the MormonLeaks.io team where his loves of transparency and Mormonism intersected. A year later, he co-founded the Truth & Transparency Foundation, a non-profit newsroom dedicated to empowering the disenfranchised by promoting transparency within religious institutions. He holds a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Utah Valley University and enjoys learning and writing about where his interests of technology, security, privacy, and religion intersect.",
