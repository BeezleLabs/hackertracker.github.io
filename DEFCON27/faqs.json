      "answer": "$300.00 USD, Cash for all four days. Everyone pays the same: The government, the media, the \u2018well known hackers\u2019, the unknown script kiddies. The only discount is for Goons and speakers, who get to work without paying for the privilege. We only accept cash - no checks, no money orders, no travelers checks. We don't want to be a target of any State or Federal fishing expeditions."

It's important to mention you should use good judgment when sharing a room and consider who is sleeping next to you and who has access to your belongings. That said, there are a lot of great people looking to save a buck or pinch a penny, good luck.\r\n"

      "updated_at": "2019-07-26T02:02+0000",
      "answer": "DEF CON charges one price regardless of your social status or affiliation. Please know that we depend on attendee income to pay the costs of the conference and don't have sponsors to help defray the expenses.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes get requests for discounts [students, veterans, children], unfortunately we don't want to try and validate if you are a current student, look at your ID to determine your age, decode military discharge papers, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to attend DEF CON for free then do something for the con. \r\n\r\nYou could: \r\nSubmit a CFP and be an accepted speaker or workshop instructor. \r\nWork on a contest, event, or village. \r\nQualify for CTF/Contests that include entry. \r\nFind a team to become a Goon newbie. \r\nContribute to content, or perform some entertainment.\r\n\r\n"

If you also require verification of housing, we can put you in touch with someone to help you get your hotel stay organized, let us know if you need that. \r\n\r\nAlong with your request, please email us the following to info(at)defcon(.)org \r\n\r\nName as is on passport: \r\nPassport number: \r\nCountry of issue:\r\nDate of issue: \r\nDate of expiration:\r\nCountry of origin:"

      "question": "Is there a free network at DEF CON?",
      "updated_at": "2019-07-26T02:03+0000",
      "answer": "Why yes, DEF CON is FULLY network-enabled. Now that we've perfected the art of a stable hacker con network, we're ascending to a higher level - we're providing you a network that you feel SAFE in using! Since DEF CON 18 we're WPA2 encrypted over-the-air, with a direct trunk out to the Internet. No peer-to-peer, no sniffing, just straight to the net (and internal servers). We'll provide login credentials at Registration. We know the 3G airwaves will be saturated so we're putting our own cred on the line to give you a net that even we would put our own mobile phones on. \r\n\r\nIf you're feeling frisky, we'll still have the traditional \"open\" network for you - bring your laptop (we'd recommend a clean OS, fully patched--you know the procedure) because we don't police what happens on that net. Share & enjoy!\r\n"

      "question": "What is the age limit?",
      "updated_at": "2019-07-26T02:04+0000",
      "answer": "People have brought children to DEF CON - it is not recommended to do this unless you are going to constantly supervise them. It is generally an \u2018adult\u2019 atmosphere (language, booze, et cetera). If you've never been to DEF CON, you may want to refrain from bringing your children (unless they are demanding that you bring them). While there are no age limits, we have consistently cooperated with parents and/or private investigators who are looking for children that \u2018ran away from home\u2019 to go to DEF CON. You must be 18 years of age or older to reserve a hotel room and to check-in. A valid ID is required upon check-in. DEF CON 27 will have enforcement of the 21 or older rule in certain \"private\" parties with possible bouncers at the doors checking IDs. This is generally the rule in all areas where alcohol is being served. However, DEF CON does not take responsibility for anything potentially indecent or offensive your minor may witness or participate in. The underage attendee is the responsibility of his or her guardian or themselves.\r\n\r\nThe presentations are open to all ages. Observation of contests as they take place on the contest floor is open to all ages.\r\n\r\nCompetition in some contests may have age restrictions due to laws. There is plenty of fun to be had without booze and gambling! There is a discussion regarding fun for those under 21 on the forums. https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=8232"

We are looking for and give preference to: unique research, new tool releases, \u00d8-day attacks (with responsible disclosure), highly technical material, social commentaries, and groundbreaking material of any kind. Want to screen a new hacking documentary or release research? Consider DEF CON.

      "answer": "If you want a space in our vendor area, you need to apply. Because of limited space and our attempt to have a diversity of vendors, you may not be able to get a booth. It is wise to think of staffing issues - if you are one person do you want to spend your entire time behind a vendors booth?"

      "updated_at": "2019-07-26T02:05+0000",
      "answer": "Please check out the DEF CON 27 Press Registration page if you wish press credentials. Lots of people come to DEF CON and are doing their job; security professionals, federal agents, and the press. It wouldn't be fair to DEF CON attendees if we exempted one group from paying. If you are a major network and plan on doing a two minute piece showing all the people with blue hair, you probably shouldn't bother applying for a press pass - you won't get one. If you are a security writer or from a real publication please submit, and someone will respond with an answer."

      "updated_at": "2019-07-26T02:06+0000",
      "answer": "It depends on what you're going to do at DEF CON. This is discussed in quite some depth on the unofficial DC FAQ. You may want to bring fancy (or outrageously silly) clothes for the Black and White Balls, annual Friday and Saturday night events where everyone shows off nifty attire. SWAG is Always recommended, people LOVE to trade! You never know when or where a t-shirt with your .org will come in handy. Government SWAG is a hot commodity, however, DT wishes to pillage those goods first! It's generally a good idea if you are a pale geek to have some sunscreen at the top of your list. Other honorable mentions are: Blister preventions, Band-aids, Gel shoe inserts, Personal cooling devices, Pain relievers and antacids, Bottle openers, Personal voice recorders, water filters, and last but not least an Alibi."
