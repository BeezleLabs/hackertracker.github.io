But it can, actually, get worse.  Say hello to the Chaos Drive, a USB drive with just a little too much chaotic energy.  I\u2019ll demonstrate how a Linux-based USB mass storage device can be set up to change the storage it presents to the host based on a set of user-defined conditions.  On the offensive side this can be used to circumvent USB scanning procedures and on the defensive side this can be used to store private files that will be undetectable without time-consuming analysis.  Attendees will learn the steps I took to build the POC and see what it can do.  For best results bring a USB OTG-capable device such as a Pi Zero or Pocketbeagle, an OTG cable, and some spare microSD cards to flash.",

There is one nice implication that might justify the increased complexity and other possible gripes:  Compared to a normal password, a combo password of the same length has far more possible combinations. This effect is increasing with password length and the number of usable keys. With three available keys and a length of two there are 9 combinations for normal passwords and 15 for combo passwords. Increasing the length to three we get 27 vs 69 combinations.  This could lead to less strict password requirements while increasing the security.  The goal of this project is to develop a free standard, a browser plugin for using combo passwords in regular login forms and implementations for popular languages, frameworks and PAM.  Visit Demo Labs and try to break a real hackers password, there will be a small reward for the fastest brute force tool!",

      "description": "Cotopaxi is a set of tools for security testing of Internet of Things devices using specific network IoT/IIoT/M2M protocols (e.g. CoAP, MQTT, DTLS, mDNS, HTCPCP). These tools will be used by penetration testers or security researchers to identify IoT services and verify security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Currently available tools used for security testing, like nmap or OpenVAS, do not support all new IoT protocols.  So possibilities to test IoT products and discover such devices in tested networks are limited.  We are working to fill this gap with Cotopaxi toolkit. Main features of our toolkit are: - Checking availability of network services for supported IoT protocols at given IPs and port ranges (\"service ping\"), - Recognizing the software used by remote network server (\"IoT software fingerprinting\") based on responses for given messages using machine learning classifier, - Discovering resources identified by given URLs (\"dirbusting\"), - Performing black-box fuzzing of IoT protocols based on corpus of packets prepared using coverage-based fuzzer,  - Identifying known vulnerabilities in IoT servers, - Detecting network traffic amplification. New features in release for Defcon27 are: - client-side versions of protocol fuzzer and vulnerability tester, - support for new protocols: SSDP and HTCPCP.",

      "description": "CSTC is a Burp Suite extension for various input transformations. It implements a generic solution that can replace numerous specialized extensions.  The CSTC solves the problem of having too specific burp plugins by being a more generic problem solving tool. It contains a wide range of very simple operations that can be chained into complex transformations. This allows a penetration tester to create the exact transformation they need to test a specific product without having to write any code. As we all know, writing code and setting everything up is time consuming.  You can configure complex input transformations for both requests and responses simply by using drag and drop. You can calculate HMACs for parts of the request, refresh timestamps, update sequence numbers or encrypt parts of the request. You can chain together different operations to create more complex transformations. You could extract parts of the request, decompress them, insert your payload using the repeater or utilizing the scanner and put it back in and compress it again before sending it. Since there are already many basic operations implemented, you can easily focus on testing the application instead of searching for extensions performing such transformations.",

There are a number of tools to uncover subdomains an organization is exposing, but individually they do not give you the complete picture. In the event that you use multiple tools, you are given an overwhelming amount of data to piece together into an aggregate view. In this talk we introduce Dr.ROBOT, a domain reconnaissance tool that was developed to run a large variety of subdomain enumeration tools. It was designed to trivially incorporate new tools as they are released by leveraging Docker and Ansible. Dr.ROBOT has three stages: gathering, inspection, and publishing. In the gathering stage, it gathers as much information as it can and aggregates the results. In the inspection phase, it captures screenshots and other information regarding the target. Finally, in the publishing phase it sends the data gathered during the previous two phases to an endpoint for manual review. Dr.ROBOT was created to serve as a comprehensive source on subdomain exposure by gathering information from as many resources as possible. It is a versatile utility for bug bounty hunters, blue teams, red teams, and many others.",

By pinpointing the exact OS of a host, an attacker can launch an educated and precise attack against a target machine.  There are lot of reasons to hide your OS to the entire world:  Revealing your OS makes things easier to find and successfully run an exploit against any of your devices. Having and unpatched or antique OS version is not very convenient for your company prestige. Imagine that your company is a bank and some users notice that you are running an unpatched box. They won't trust you any longer! In addition, these kind of 'bad' news are always sent to the public opinion. Knowing your OS can also become more dangerous, because people can guess which applications are you running in that OS (data inference). For example if your system is a MS Windows, and you are running a database, it's highly likely that you are running MS-SQL. It could be convenient for other software companies, to offer you a new OS environment (because they know which you are running). And finally, privacy; nobody needs to know the systems you've got running. OSfooler was presented at Blackhat Arsenal 2013. It was built on NFQUEUE, an iptables/ip6tables target which delegate the decision on packets to a userspace. It transparently intercepted all traffic that your box was sending in order to camouflage and modify in real time the flags in TCP/IP packets that discover your system.  OSfooler-NG has been complete rewriten from the ground up, being highly portable, more efficient and combining all known techniques to detect and defeat at the same time:  Active remote OS fingerprinting: like Nmap Passive remote OS fingeprinting: like p0f v2 Commercial engines like Sourcefire\u2019s FireSiGHT OS fingerprinting Some additional features are:  No need for kernel modification or patches Simple user interface and several logging features Transparent for users, internal process and services Detecting and defeating mode: active, passive & combined Will emulate any OS Capable of handling updated nmap and p0f v2 fingerprint database Undetectable for the attacker",

Even if it narrows the combination pool significantly, it\u2019s still too large to use for online attacks or offline attacks with low hardware resources.  In the real world, a password\u2019s structure is an unknown value, just like the password itself. Even if we specify a password structure with masks, we are still brute forcing characters in the mask. When we analyzed Ashley Madison and Myspace wordlists, we saw that they are mostly consists of sequential alpha characters. Which means that there is a high probability that they are meaningful words. Our research shows that 30% of the Ashley Madison wordlist and 36% of Myspace wordlist contains meaningful English words.  Rhodiola tool is developed to narrow the combination pool by creating a personalized wordlist for target people.

It does not have all the capabilities of a compiler, but it simplifies a lot the shellcode development process. There is no need to write assembler, it is only required to declare and call functions or system calls.  Under the hood there is, of course, a custom compiler which compiles C/C++ style code into ASM which is later assembled using Keystone framework.

Turns out by harnessing the sheer craziness of the .NET framework, you can embed entire interpreters inside of .NET languages allowing you to natively execute scripts written in third-party languages (like Python) on windows! Not only does this allow you to dynamically access all of the .NET API from a scripting language of your choosing, but it also allows you to still remain completely in memory and has a number of advantages over traditional C# payloads! Essentially, BYOI payloads allow you to have all the \"power\" of PowerShell, without going through PowerShell in anyway! Additionally, you can nest multiple interpreters within each other to perform what I've coined \"engine inception\"!

      "description": "Vulmap is an open source online local vulnerability scanner project. It consists of online local vulnerability scanning scripts for Windows and Linux. These scripts can be used for defensive and offensive purposes. It is possible to conduct vulnerability assessments by using these scripts. Also they can be used for privilege escalation by pentesters/red teamers.  Vulmap scans vulnerabilities on localhost, shows related exploits and downloads them. It basically, scan localhost to gather installed software information and ask Vulmon API if there are any vulnerabilities and exploits related with installed software. If any vulnerability exists, Vulmap shows CVE ID, risk score, vulnerability's detail link, exploit ids and exploit titles. Exploits can be downloaded with Vulmap also.  Main idea of Vulmap is getting real-time vulnerability data from Vulmon instead of relying of a local vulnerability database. Even the most recent vulnerabilities can be detected with this approach. Also its exploit download feature helps privilege escalation process.  Since most Linux installations have Python, Vulmap Linux is developed with Python while Vulmap Windows is developed with PowerShell to make it easy to run it on most Windows versions without any installation.",

You may reconsider after watching a demo of our new hacking toolkit, ZigDiggity, where we target door & window sensors using an \"ACK Attack\". ZigDiggity will emerge as the weapon of choice for testing Zigbee-enabled systems, replacing all previous efforts.  Zigbee continues to grow in popularity as a method for providing simple wireless communication between devices (i.e. low power/traffic, short distance), & can be found in a variety of consumer products that range from smart home automation to healthcare.   Unfortunately, existing Zigbee hacking solutions have fallen into disrepair, having barely been maintained, let alone improved upon. Left without a practical way to evaluate the security of Zigbee networks, we've created ZigDiggity, a new open-source pentest arsenal from Bishop Fox.  Updates include migration to better hardware for testing (e.g. SDRs), and a slew of newly implemented Zigbee attacks types.  Our DEMO-rich presentation showcases ZigDiggity's attack capabilities by pitting it against common Internet of Things (IoT) products that use Zigbee. Come experience the future of Zigbee hacking, in a talk that the New York Times will be hailing as \"a veritable triumph of the human spirit.\" ... ya know, probably",

This will include:\n\n- A run-through of a basic red team campaign\n- The properties of a solid malware implant\n- Spinning-up Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, including burner inbound proxies, etc.\n- Configuring an implant to find and utilise outbound routes from a realistic corporate network, and to call back to our new infrastructure\n- Basic delivery of malware via common delivery routes\n- Gaining a persistent presence, and identifying routes to the campaign objectives\n\nWe will be using Meterpreter and the Metasploit framework as the implant supported by Kali Linux, alongside Apache as a reverse proxy; all of which will be cloud-hosted. We will be using a variety of post-exploitation techniques to help attendees get to grips with some of the potential nuances of remote malware interaction (long RTTs, blind command execution, etc.).\n\nReading list:\n\nhttps://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf\nhttps://ionize.com.au/reverse-https-meterpreter-and-empire-behind-nginx/\nhttps://medium.com/@truekonrads/reverse-https-meterpreter-behind-apache-or-any-other-reverse-ssl-proxy-e898f9dfff54",

      "description": "Layer 2 can be a lesser-known attack surface; the techniques have been known for a while, have well-documented mitigations, and are often thought of as so old, they _can't possibly still be around, right?_ \n\nBut this under-represented attack surface is also of great value to an attacker. Network segregation on a typical internal network is commonplace, and often heavily relied upon to segregate, isolate, and limit the spread of a compromise. A misconfigured switch or switch port can be the difference between an attacker compromising the desk phones, and core business server infrastructure. And when the misconfiguration can be a single two-word line in a ten-thousand line switch configuration file, it's easy to see how the basic hardening controls can be missed.\n\nThis workshop will run through analysing Layer 2 network traffic, identifying protocols and information of interest within network traffic, launching DTP attacks to pivot within a misconfigured network, and man-in-the-middling traffic via this pivot to compromise a target host (including using various tools in conjunction with virtual network interfaces). In terms of tooling, we will be looking to utilise the likes of Wireshark, Yersinia and Bettercap to launch the various network attacks, with standard Kali tooling/normal Linux functionality to exploit and escalate privileges on the target host. \n\nReading list (not required, but can be of interest):\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_arp/configuration/15-mt/arp-15-mt-book/arp-config-arp.html\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960/software/release/12-2_53_se/configuration/guide/2960scg/swvlan.html\nhttps://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/vlan-tagging-explained-with-dtp-protocol.html\nhttps://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/bh-us-02-convery-switches.pdf\nhttps://digi.ninja/blog/abusing_dtp.php",

      "description": "This is an introduction to functional programming concepts. It's not an intro to a language or a tool, but to a set of ideas. It's a powerful one for any hacker to learn, but especially for blue teamers who find themselves writing or maintaining increasingly complex code. Practicing it can help defenders write safer code that scales well.\n\nWhy speak particularly toward blue team? \n\nDefenders are often unsung heros today. Blue teamers, like system admins, may find themselves writing code to glue things together, fill in the gaps between existing tools, or make up for lack of tools altogether. If your codebase evolves into a critical system, the work of managing its rising complexity can become a serious challenge. Defense is hard, and studying the esoterics of software architecture can be a rare luxury (or an exercise in frustration, depending on your situation.) This workshop aims to hand you the distilled, demystified truth, sans the cryptic terminology. We will collectively build some code that illustrates the philosophy of the functional paradigm, and has a good chance of being useful in your work.\n\nWhy functional programming? \n\nThis is a paradigm from the days of Lisp and the original generation of MIT hackers. After decades of obscurity, it is moving into the mainstream because it answers two serious problems particularly well: rising code complexity, and the need to support parallelism. Any parts of it that you take away from this workshop are likely to improve your quality of life as a software engineer.\n\nFor this workshop, we will choose two programming languages to work with: one for comfort, and one for stretching. Python will be the comfort language, because of its widespread use in many fields. Haskell will be the stretch language, and no one is expected to try it if they're not comfortable. What we want is for you to get a sense of how the functional approach looks, not just in a mainstream language like Python, but also in a language built especially with the functional style in mind.",

In order to evade detection it is not uncommon for these malicious documents to execute a long chain of scripts involving macros, Javascript, and PowerShell before downloading the final payload. As a result incident responders and malware analysts need to be comfortable analyzing different document formats, and script languages to make sense of these delivery chains.\n\nIn this workshop you will work through the triage of a live malware delivery chain that includes a malicious document, malicious scripts, and a final malware payload. During this process you will be exposed to different document formats, and malscripts while you practice the skills required to manually analyze these delivery chains. This workshop focuses on the fundamental analysis techniques used when identifying, deobfuscating, and analyzing maldocs and malscripts. However, we will also provide an introduction to some free and open source tools that can be used to speed up the analysis process. \n\nThis workshop is aimed at junior incident responders, hobby malware analysts, and general security or IT practitioners who are interested in learning more about the malware triage process. If you have no experience with malware analysis but you have a good understanding of scripting languages like VBScript, and Javascript, and you are familiar with windows internals you should have no problem completing the workshop. \n\nYou will be provided with a VirtualMachine to use during the workshop, please make sure to bring a laptop that meets the following requirements. Your laptop must have VirtualBox or VMWare installed and working prior to the start of the course. Your laptop must have at least 60GB of disk space free, preferably 100GB.

However, we have found that since MacOS is the minority platform for many software packages and security platforms, it rarely gets the same attention from security vendors as Windows. This workshop will teach you to exploit that lack of attention from software like Microsoft Office and security platforms like a leading EDR solution to break in and out of a MacOS estate. The principles also apply to other *nix environments like Linux.\n\nWe will walk you through how to use open source tools, both unmodified and customized, can be used to take advantage of the difference in capability, e.g., script detection, between Windows and non-Windows platforms. We will show you how to map out an environment, how to gain code execution in multiple ways, grab credentials, find files, collect screenshots and webcam shots and exfiltrate the loot while remaining undetected.\n\nThe key takeaway is that despite the myriad of operating system security features present in MacOS and Linux, and the addition of EDR, protected MacOS or Linux environments can still be compromised by a diligent attacker using open source tooling. This workshop will show you how!\n\n[Unfortunately we cannot provide an EDR system for you to play with, so please bring your own or practice the techniques without that particular opponent.]",

Wi-Fi extends the perimeter of a supposedly-secure network to sidewalks, parking lots, and trendy coffee shops. But many hackers don't know how Wi-Fi is simultaneously both easy and difficult to attack. To understand this duality, hackers must get hands-on time attacking all kinds of networks. You really need to see both success and failure, both self-inflicted and environmental, to fully understand how to compromise Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nThis workshop isn't targeted at Faraday-level attendees. We assume that you know what a laptop and Wi-Fi is and continue from there. What you'll be doing in this workshop is:\n\n\n0. Determining your desired result of the attack\n\n1. Reconnoitering Wi-Fi networks and RF spectrum\n\n2. Identifying and prioritizing network and station targets\n\n3. Determining the best attack type for identified targets\n\n4. Hacking the bejeezus out of the target while avoiding detection\n\n\nYou'll do all of these amazing things with your laptop and Kali Linux. Kali has an exceptional set of Wi-Fi hacking tools built right in that you'll become much more familiar with during this session. You'll use a variety of tools to identify networks and connected stations, conduct broadcast denial of service attacks, capture authentication handshakes, and crack session keys.\n\n\nPip and Alex will demonstrate some techniques using different hardware like spectrum analyzers and noise generators so you can decide whether those are tools you want to add to your toolbox as well. However, none of those tools are necessary for the workshop, and many hackers never need anything beyond a laptop, Kali, a good wordlist, and practice.\n\n\nWe'll tweet any last minute workshop updates or preparation steps from @alexhammeratt.",

Another aspect of the training will cover vulnerabilities found in IoT infrastructure with a focus on IP cameras and video management servers. These often run insecure protocols like zeroconf and have web portals that are easily authentication brute-forceable and poorly configured. We are specifically going to examine the WS-Discovery protocol which provides some interesting attack vectors by putting too much trust on the local network.\n\n\nHands-on exercises will be conducted by the students throughout the training for each section under the guidance of the instructors.",

Traditional Exploit Kits (EKs) have the ability to fingerprint and compromise web browser environments, but with the advent of sandboxing and advanced security measures, there has been a shift toward using the Microsoft Office environment as a primary attack surface. Document Exploit Kits (DEKs) leverage DCOM, ActiveX controls, and logic bugs to compromise machines by packing multiple exploits into a single file.\n\nIn this workshop you will learn how to analyze exploits, shellcode, and infection chains produced by modern Document Exploit Kits such as ThreadKit and VenomKit.\n\nThis workshop is aimed at security professionals who are interested in gaining experience with reverse engineering, malware analysis and exploit development. Previous experience in any of these areas will assist the attendee in completing the workshop successfully in a timely fashion. The skills learned in this workshop are most applicable to those who work or are interested in blue team areas, such as those in security operations centers (SOCs), incident responders, intel analysts, and reverse engineers. Those who work or are interested in red team areas will find the content applicable for re-implementation for use in offensive exercises.\n\nThe following tools will be used in this workshop:\n\n- rtfobj for OLE object extraction\n- x64dbg for dynamic analysis of exploits, shellcode, and infection chains\n- procmon and procexp for dynamic analysis of infection chains\n- IDA Pro for static analysis of vulnerable applications and shellcode\n- ffdec for static analysis of Adobe Flash exploits\n- FakeNet-NG and Wireshark for network traffic analysis",

This workshop will offer security professionals a deep dive into Kerberos delegation and demonstrate how it can be abused for privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n\nWe will open with a crash-course in Microsoft's Kerberos implementation and its delegation features, from the fundamentals of Kerberos authentication, through legacy unconstrained delegation, to classic constrained delegation. We will offer demos and hands-on labs to experiment with abusing these features.\n\nIn the second half of the workshop, we will cover resource-based constrained delegation, explain the differences between classic constrained delegation and resource-based constrained delegation, and explore novel attack primitives including:\n- Compromising hosts by modifying Active Directory computer objects\n- Bypassing restrictions on protocol transition to impersonate arbitrary users\n- Compromising a host by abusing the ticket-granting-ticket of a computer account\n- Performing local privilege escalation on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 hosts by abusing account profile pictures\n- Performing remote code execution on SQL Servers through directory listing abuse\n- Achieving hostless domain persistence\n\nParticipants will get an opportunity to try the above attacks in a lab environment.\n\nWe will also explore mitigating controls, as well as detection opportunities.",

And it is mostly true for critical infrastructures that must comply with multiple laws around the world. But what about the most critical components such as PLCs?\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn how to attack PLCs, by attacking ICS protocols: a well-known legacy protocol, Modbus, as well as an open source protocol considered as the future of ICS communications, OPC-UA. And to do so, what could be better than giving you hands-on experience on real devices by hacking our model train?\n\nWe will start by defining industrial control systems and its main components, as well as explaining the key risks and vulnerabilities that affect them. We will then focus on their key assets, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and discover how they work, how they communicate, how they can be programmed to learn the methods and tools you can use to p*wn them.\n\nThen we will move on to real-world by attacking real PLCs from two major manufacturers on a dedicated setup featuring robot arms and a model train!

We also exploited them on one of the most widely used Web server (Apache+PHP) and one of the most commonly used developer tool (Git).\n\nIn this presentation, we will share how we try to crack the Google Home from both hardware and software aspects, get and analyze the newest firmware, solve the problem, and introduce new methods to discover vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl through Fuzz and manual auditing. Through these methods, we found \"Magellan\", a set of three heap buffer overflow and heap data disclosure vulnerabilities in SQLite ( CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505 CVE-2018-20506 ) We also found \"Dias\", two remote memory leak and stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Curl ( CVE-2018-16890 and CVE-2019-3822 ). Considering the fact that these vulnerabilities affect many systems and software, we have issued a vulnerability alert to notify the vulnerable vendor to fix it.\n\nWe will disclose the details of \"Magellan\" and \"Dias\" for the first time and highlight some of our new vulnerability exploitation techniques. In the first part, we will introduce the results of our analysis on hardware, how to get the newest firmware from simulating an update request, and attack surface of Google Home. We will show how to use Magellan to complete the remote exploit of Google Home, we will also give a brefing talk about how to use Dias to complete the remote attack on Apache+PHP and Git. Finally, we will summarize our research and provide some security development advice to the basic software library developers.",

      "description": "Shor's Algorithm for factoring integer numbers is the big threat to cryptography (RSA/ECC) as it reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, which means a Quantum Computer can reduce the time to crack RSA-2048 to a mere 10 seconds. However current noisy NISQ type quantum computers are very limited to something like 16 bit RSA keys. And the quality of the current qubits is so bad that error-correction comes at a massive cost of at least 100 times the amount of qubits.\n\nWhile the world is pre-occupied whether we have universal quantum computers big enough for Shor's algorithm, Quantum Annealing is stealing the show with having factored a 20-bit number just in January this year using 97 qubits. And these qubits are actually good enough to factor bigger numbers. If we assume a linear scalability, we'd \"only\" need around 10,000 qubits to factor a 2048bit RSA key. D-Wave announced a quantum computer with 5,640 qubits, so that puts it within reach soon. \n\nSo, could Quantum Annealing be more of a threat to cryptography than Shor's algorithm on universal quantum computers? How do these algorithms work? How do they achieve a polynomial complexity to what traditional computers need exponential time? What impact will this have on the competition from NIST for the design of post-quantum-cryptography algorithms?",

Meanwhile, mitigations introduced by operating systems make them harder to be exploited. More and more applications are using hybrid technologies, so we can try web security tricks to pwn them reliably with less effort.\n\nOur presentation will summarize attack surfaces and methods to find security issues in desktop applications. In particular, we will explicate some real-world cases, such as chaining multiple vulnerabilities (information leaking, CSP bypass, opened debugging port) to achieve RCE in a specialized IDE, sensitive file leaking in famous editors, privileged APIs abusing in many IM applications and so on. During our research, we find some issues actually reside in popular libraries. These flaws may affect more applications than we will demonstrate in this talk.\n\nWeb security knowledge is usually unfamiliar to desktop application developers. Attacking desktop apps using web security tricks is a non-competitive \"blue ocean\". Our presentation will focus on many design misconceptions and implementation mistakes in desktop applications. By sharing these representative lessons, we hope to help desktop application developers improve the security of their products.",

Moreover, keys are just pieces of metal - we will present numerous practical techniques to create restricted keys without authorisation - including new attacks on Medeco, Mul-T-Lock and Abloy key control systems.

It is a redesign of Linux's original in-kernel BPF bytecode VM used to power features like tcpdump filters. eBPF has an entirely different set of capabilities and instructions, with its primary goal being to serve as a JIT-able virtual machine instruction set that can be targeted by compilers of a memory-safe \"restricted C\" language. In the Linux kernel, it is actively being applied to anything and everything to provide performant programmatic capabilities to userland that extend traditionally kernel-based functionality.\n\nIn this exploit development focused talk, we will first introduce eBPF and discuss several nefarious techniques enabled by the technology. As we do so, we will cover the respective sets of APIs, file descriptor types, and other eBPF machinery that enable such techniques, building up from various forms of hidden IPC channels to full-fledged rootkits. Within this talk, we will walk through the implementations of the techniques we discuss so that attendees will walk away with the knowledge of how to implement their own variants. Along the way we will discuss novel container breakout techniques and interesting \"dual-purpose\" eBPF features that enable the development of mutative syscall hooks that work for processes that work for processes already attached by a debugger. Finally, we will provide insight on how defenders should begin to attempt to detect and recover from such abuses, when possible at all.\n\nThis presentation significantly extends on work we first presented at 35C3, which focused more heavily on the underlying aspects of general eBPF-based kernel tracing. In contrast, this talk will demo new techniques and include substantially improved versions of techniques presented previously as proofs-of-concept.",

      "description": "Computer security is now a public policy issue. Election security, blockchain, \"going dark,\" the vulnerabilities equities debate, IoT safety , data privacy, algorithmic security and fairness, critical infrastructure: these are all important public policy issues with a strong Internet security component. But while an understanding of the technology involved is fundamental to crafting good policy, there is little involvement of technologists in policy discussions. This is not sustainable. We need public-interest technologists: people from our fields helping craft policy, and working to provide security to agencies and groups working in the broader public interest. We need these people in government, at NGOs, teaching at universities, as part of the press, and inside private companies. This is increasingly critical to both public safety and overall social welfare. This talk both describes the current state of public-interest technology, and offers a way forward for us individually and collectively for our field. The defining policy question of the Internet age is this: How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms? We need to be involved in that debate.SSL VPNs protect corporate assets from Internet exposure, but what if SSL VPNs themselves are vulnerable? They\u00edre exposed to the Internet, trusted to reliably guard the only way to intranet. However, we found pre-auth RCEs on multiple leading SSL VPNs, used by nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies and many government organizations. To make things worse, a \u00ecmagic\u00ee backdoor was found to allow changing any user\u00eds password with no credentials required! To show how bad things can go, we will demonstrate gaining root shell from the only exposed HTTPS port, covertly weaponizing the server against their owner, and abusing a hidden feature to take over all VPN clients!\n\nIn such complicated closed-source systems, gaining root shell from outside the box certainly ain\u00edt easy. It takes advanced web and binary exploitation techniques to struggle for a way to root shell, which involves abusing defects in web architectures, hard-core Apache jemalloc exploitation and more. We will cover every detail of all the dirty tricks, crazy bug chains, and the built-in backdoor. After gaining root shell into the box, we then elaborate on post exploitation and how we hack back the clients. In addition, we will share the attack vectors against SSL VPNs to kick start researches on similar targets. On the other hand, from our previous experience, we derive general hardening actions that mitigate not only all the above attacks, but any other potential 0days.\n\nIn summary, we disclose practical attacks capable of compromising millions of targets, including tech giants and many industry leaders. These techniques and methodologies are published in the hope that it can inspire more security researchers to think out-of-the-box; enterprises can apply immediate mitigation, and realize that SSL VPN is not merely Virtual Private Network, but also a \u00ecVulnerable Point of your Network\u00ee.",

      "description": "The 2016 WWDC saw the dawn of Apple Pay Web, an API that lets websites embed an Apple Pay button within their web-facing stores.  Supporting it required a complex request flow, complete with client certificates and a custom session server. This proved detrimental, since Apple failed to caution against important side effects of taking in untrusted URLs.  As a result, many new SSRF vulnerabilities entered the world. Worse yet, while they were exploitable and discoverable in similar ways, they were spread across distinct codebases in several programming languages, so could not be patched in any generic way.\n\nApple is not alone - in the process of gluing the web together, Twilio, Salesforce, and others have all created similarly broad attack surfaces.  When companies fail to take an honest, empathetic look at how clients will use a product, they shove along hidden security burdens. Those who integrate with an API have less context than those who create it, so are in a worse position to recognize these risks.\n\nEngineers have been talking about defensive programming for decades, but top companies still have trouble practicing it.  In this talk we explore these mistakes with demos of affected software, and introduce a powerful model for finding broad classes of bugs.",

      "description": "Pointer Authentication (in short, PAuth) is the latest security mechanism in iOS. It is proposed to protect the integrity of pointers with hardware-assisted encryption, thus eliminating the threats of code-reuse attacks. In PAuth, a cryptographic signature called PAC is calculated from a pointer value and inserted into the pointer. When the pointer is about to be used, the PAC is extracted and verified whether it is consistent with the original pointer value. In this way, PAuth is able to ensure that the pointers are not tampered. iOS deployed PAuth in user-space system services, protecting pointers that may affect the control flow and preventing code-reuse attacks like ROP and JOP.\n\n    However, in our study, we found that a fatal flaw in the implementation of iOS PAuth makes user-space system services till vulnerable to code-reuse attacks. The flaw is: iOS uses the same signing key in different user-space processes. This flaw allows a signed pointer from a malicious process can be correctly verified in a system service, thus making it possible to launch JOP. In this talk, we will explain how we found the flaw and why it is inevitable. In advance, we will demonstrate how to leverage this flaw and launch JOP attacks in a PAuth-protected system service. Also, we will propose a new tool, PAC-gadget, to automatically find JOP gadgets in PAuth-protected binaries.",

      "description": "Like most modern devices, building controllers have increasingly become network connected, exposing them to a wider range of threats. If malicious actors could manipulate access control systems, boiler rooms, or temperature control for critical industrial systems, the potential for catastrophic damage is extreme.\n\nMcAfee's ATR team has discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a major building controller.  This controller is a fully programmable native BACnet\u00f4 device designed to manage a wide range of building systems.  By modifying BACnet broadcast traffic, a buffer overflow can be leveraged into a write-what-where (WWW) condition. This WWW leads to execution control, providing the attacker with a root shell and complete control over the device remotely.  Because this attack vector is through BACnet broadcast traffic, there is no authentication mechanism for the target device, allowing anyone on the same network to communicate with it directly and exploit the vulnerability without authentication. Currently, there are over 500 of these devices connected to the internet running in BACnet/IP Broadcast Management Device (BBMD) mode.  Utilizing this mode, broadcast traffic can travel over the internet, increasing the potentially devastating impact of this vulnerability.\n\nThis presentation will include a deep technical analysis of the vulnerability discovery process and demos illustrating an attack in a critical scenario.  Finally, we will discuss the steps taken by the vendor to patch this vulnerability and demonstrate its effectiveness.",

However, this assumes that keys are chosen properly, and that there is no way to determine whether a key is the correct one after a candidate key is used to decrypt a captured ciphertext.  In practice, these conditions do not always hold. In much the same way that hash functions are impossible to reverse but hash cracking is still a practical attack, in the real world it is often possible to perform practical key search attacks. In this talk, we will discuss the common mistakes and common conditions that allow for practical brute force recovery of keys for modern block ciphers such as AES.

The manipulation is mainly based on abusing ReadProcessMemory and calling conventions in X64. In addition to presenting Inject-Me, the talk will mention a generalized approach to copying data in remote processes to recreate shellcode from the injecting process.",

This talk will take you on a journey through the successes and failures that lead to the creation of the WiFiCactus and the over 1 TB of data captured. A history of each capture project including a summary of the most interesting pieces of data will be shown.\n\nMany people spread a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt about the wireless environments during DEF CON. This presentation aims to bring some clarity to what is really happening in the airwaves during one of the largest hacker conferences in the world. This will include presenting data on the attacks and sensitive information that exists in the airwaves. This presentation will demonstrate the risks of using wireless networks and information leaks that can be captured by anyone who is passively listening. Countermeasures and protection strategies will be provided to help you avoid having your data captured by those who might be listening. \n\nWith the number of connected devices around us, there has never been a better time to start wardriving or warwalking. Everyone is capable of profiling wireless data around them thanks to cheap hardware and open source tools. As hackers it is important for us to discover issues and vulnerabilities while validating claims of security by software and hardware vendors. Monitoring wireless communication is a great way to start validating those claims. All of the hardware and methods used will be provided so that anyone can do this type of monitoring on their own.

      "description": "Return-oriented Programming (ROP) has been the predominate code-reuse attack for over a decade, but there are other options. Many mitigations can detect ROP due to heuristics, but these fail to detect Jump-oriented Programming (JOP). The JOP ROCKET is a reverse engineering framework dedicated to facilitating JOP exploits. It allows hackers to discover JOP gadgets. This includes dispatcher gadget's, which helps to subvert and direct the control flow, and functional gadgets, our primitives. This tool provides numerous options to give hackers flexibility on how to find gadgets, to narrow and expand possibilities. Additionally, the tool uses opcode-splitting to discover many unintended gadgets. All gadgets are classified based on operation as well as registers used and affected. Thus, hackers could easily obtain the desired functional gadgets, such as MOV EBX, [VALUE], using simple language commands. Because of JOP's much more complex set up, the tool provides this classification, so time isn\u00edt wasted hunting through results.\n\nJOP is rarely done in the wild. Part of that complexity is in set up, but another part is the lack of dedicated tools. Having to find JOP gadgets manually could be time-consuming and require expertise. JOP ROCKET simplifies that, allowing the JOP gadgets to be found quickly and easily.\n\nThis talk will give brief content on ROP, and then it introduces JOP and its history. Then we will dive into JOP ROCKET, discussing its features, how to use it to find JOP gadgets, and how to set up your own JOP exploit. We will then demo the tool.",

Instead of targeting the underlying cryptographic primitives, our attacks abuse legitimate features of the MIME standard and HTML, as supported by email clients, to deceive the user regarding the actual message content. We demonstrate how the attacker can unknowingly abuse the user as a decryption oracle by replying to an unsuspicious looking email. Using this technique, the plaintext of hundreds of encrypted emails can be leaked at once. Furthermore, we show how users could be tricked into signing arbitrary text by replying to emails containing CSS conditional rules. An evaluation shows that 17 out of 19 OpenPGP-capable email clients, as well as 21 out of 22 clients supporting S/MIME, are vulnerable to at least one attack. We provide different countermeasures and discuss their advantages and disadvantages",

Valve, Facebook, Elon Musk and more are funding research into technologies that will translate neural signals into controls for devices like computers, smartphones, and VR/AR environments.  While this would be super exciting, it represents some serious data privacy issues.  First: what kind of private information can be elicited from your neural signals?  It\u00eds possible to use a specific kind of neural response to visual and audio stimuli to deduce information about the user\u00d6 like where you bank, who you know, your real identity, etc (Edward Nygma in Batman Forever, anyone?)  \nMore broadly, there is also the issue of what happens when you provide your neural signals to a company.  If you\u00edre worried about what Facebook is doing with your information now, imagine what they can do when they have hours of information straight from your brain.  If neural data is treated the same as your DNA, commercial companies become the owners of your thoughts (as electrical signals).  Will they readily share it with the FBI without probable cause?  These kinds of questions, and many more, are starting to surface with neurally-controlled devices and other emerging technologies.  This talk will cover all of this and more.",

Back then, wresting the power to understand & modify apps on our devices from dystopian looking mega corps was our cause. As jailbreaks became infrequent, the hackers\u00ed arsenal was left behind. While this is progress against dark uses of hacking, done to protect our freedom fighters, how can hackers still hold power to account? Can we still find flaws in apps/devices & live up to the protections the technology promises? \n\nEnter runtime binary instrumentation with Frida. It\u00eds possible to analyze apps in their final state when executed on real hardware running the latest iOS/Android with no jailbreaks. This fills a gap between source analysis & debuggers. But, simply enumerating app classes requires studying multiple blogs & a deep read of the docs. We created Objection to simplify this & hide the boilerplate so hackers could focus on unravelling apps. But, many people still rely on simple hacks & automation & rarely use new advanced techniques such as reflectively inspecting live heap objects, canary execution tracing, runtime memory edits and filesystem exploration.\n\nWe\u00edll show hackers, malware researchers & security engineers how to use these advanced mobile hacking techniques.",

This new algorithm is based on a brand new pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to provide better collision avoidance while kicking out all of our good old sniffing tools.\n\nUnless some random hacker manages to break this not-that-strong PRNG and upgrades his BLE sniffing tool to support this algorithm ;).

However, security controls for network devices such as enterprise printers are often ignored and thus present a greater potential for exploitation and compromise by threat actors seeking to gain a persistent foothold on target organisations.\n\nIn order to assess the current state of mainstream enterprise printer product security and to challenge common assumptions made about the security of these devices, which sit on key parts of enterprise networks and process sensitive data, we set out on a vulnerability and exploitation research project of six known vendors. We were able to find remote vulnerabilities in all printers tested through various attack vectors, revealing a large number of 0-day vulnerabilities in the process.\n\nIn this talk we walk through the entire research engagement, from initial phases such as threat modelling to understand printer attack surfaces to the development of attack methodologies and fuzzing tools used to target printer-specific protocols and functions. Besides of remarking important vulnerabilities found and their respective CVE\u00eds, proof of concept exploits showing how it is possible to gain full control of printers and all of the data they manage will be presented. This will show how to use enterprise printers as a method of persistence on a network, perhaps to exfiltrate sensitive data or support C2 persistence on Red Team engagements.\n\nWe also address a number of challenges that researchers can face when performing vulnerability research on devices such as printers and how we used different techniques to overcome these challenges, working with limited to no debugging and triage capabilities. We also present mitigations that printer manufacturers can implement in order to reduce printer attack surfaces and render exploitation more difficult.",

Applicable only at the local computer level, a user generally has different rights (through access tokens) on different machines in a domain. Another part of the access control model is security descriptors (ACLs) that protects a securable object. At the domain level, ACL abuse is well known and adversaries have used it for persistence. For user rights, the abuse is mostly with the help of groups (memberships, SID History etc.) or misconfigured delegated rights. \n\nA lesser-known area of abuse and offensive research is a combination of minimal Rights and ACE (hence the term RACE). Often overlooked in audits and assessments, using minimal rights along with favourable ACEs provides a very interesting technique of persistence and on-demand privilege escalation on a Windows machine with much desired stealth.\nThis talk covers interesting domain privilege escalation, persistence and backdoor techniques with the help of ACLs, minimal user rights and combinations of both. We will discuss how these techniques can be applied using open source tools and scripts. The talk also covers how to detect and mitigate such attacks. \n\nThe talk will be full of live demonstrations.",

In all implementations the standard requires GSM messages to first be error control encoded using a convolutional code and then encrypted. In the vast majority of implementations used today, encryption is performed using the A5/1 or A5/3 cipher. The convolutional code adds redundancy to the transmitted message, which can act like a fingerprint to identify the key used to encrypt the GSM message.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability an attacker simply needs to capture a transmission and identify the GSM channel used. The standard defines the convolutional code and therefore how the redundancy may be interpreted to recover the encryption key.\n\nThis presentation considers passively capturing GSM traffic using A5/3 encryption and demonstrates a novel solution to cracking the key used without interacting with the mobile or network.",

Binee mimics much of the OS kernel and outputs a detailed description of all function calls with human readable parameters through the duration of the process. We've designed Binee with two primary use cases in mind; data extraction at scale with a cost and speed similar to common static analysis tools, and second, for malware analysts that need a custom operating system and framework without the overhead of spinning up various configurations of virtual machines.

That probably means, over the next few years, more and more people are going to be using more and more cellular-connected devices for their day-to-day TCP/IP activities.\n\nThe problem is, a lot of existing 4G modems and routers are pretty insecure. We found critical remotely-exploitable flaws in a selection of devices from variety of vendors, without having to do too much work. Plus, there\u00eds only a small pool of OEMs working seriously with cellular technologies, and their hardware (& software dependencies) can be found running in all sorts of places. Their old 4G, 3G and even 2G-era code is going to be running in these 5G-capable devices.\n\nWith a small sample of consumer 4G routers as examples, we\u00edre going to talk about how malleable, frustrating, and insecure these devices are. We\u00edll run through a few examples of existing 4G routers, from low-end bargain-basement end-of-life-never-to-be-fixed to higher-end devices. root is a means to an end, rather than the goal.",

This makes vacuum cleaning robot ecosystems interesting for further analysis to understand their security mechanisms and derive takeaways.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we discuss the security of the well-protected Neato and Vorwerk ecosystems. Their robots run the proprietary QNX operating system, are locally protected with secure boot, and use various mechanisms that ensure authentication and encryption in the cloud communication.

After a quick review of basic knowledge about uC, we will dive into three different approaches to achieve payload injection, from basic to advanced techniques. The first method consists on locating the entry point of the firmware and inject our payload there, this is an easy way to execute it at least once. As a second -and more complex- technique, we will backdoor the EUSART communication injecting a malicious payload at the code routine of that hardware peripheral; we will be able to get the right memory address by inspecting the GIE, PEIE and polling process at the uC interrupt vector. Finally, the third technique allow us to take control of the microcontroller\u00eds program flow by manipulating the stack writing memory addresses at the TOS; with this we can execute a payload made with instructions already written in the original program, performing it just like a ROP-chain technique.",

However, we found that most of them will also open a door for attackers to steal your files and even more.\n\nFirst, we did a comprehensive research about all top mobile vendors' pre-installed nearby sharing apps by reverse engineering. Many serious vulnerabilities are found on most of them and reported to vendors. Algorithm and design flaws in these apps can lead to file leaking and tampering, privacy leaks, arbitrary file downloads and even remote code execution. We will present all the related vulnerabilities' details and exploit techniques. Next, we conducted the same research on lots of third-party file sharing apps and found that they are even worse about security and are used by surprising more than 1 billion users. Files transferred between them are nearly naked when our MITM attack devices are nearby. Finally, we will summarize all the attack vectors and two common attack models. We will also present the attack demos and related tools.\n\nBesides, we will present our practical mitigations.

Without the debugger, it's difficult to inspect the program flow and runtime status. On Qualcomm platform, subsystems are protected by the Secure Boot and unable to be touched externally. We'll introduce the vulnerability we found in Modem to defeat the Secure Boot and elevate privilege into Modem locally so that we can setup the live debugger for baseband.\n\nThe Modem and WLAN firmware is quite complex and reverse engineering is a tough work. Thanks to the debugger, we finally figure out the system architecture, the components, the program flow, the data flow, and the attack surfaces of WLAN firmware. We'll share these techniques in detail, along with the zero-days we found on the attack surfaces.\n\nThere are multiple mitigations on Qualcomm baseband, including DEP, stack protection, heap cookie, system call constraint, etc. All the details of the exploitation and mitigation bypassing techniques will be given during the presentation.\n\nStarting from Snapdragon 835, WLAN firmware is integrated into the Modem subsystem as an isolated userspace process. We'll discuss these constraints, and then leverage the weakness we found to fully exploit into Modem.",

But when you get back to your hotel the real shock hits you: someone infected your camera with ransomware! All your images are encrypted, and the camera is locked. How could that happen?In this talk, we show a live demo of this exact scenario. Join us as we take a deep dive into the world of the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP). The same protocol that allows you to control your camera from your phone or computer, can also enable any attacker to do that and more. We will describe in detail how we found multiple vulnerabilities in the protocol and how we exploited them remotely(!) to take over this embedded device.But it doesn't end here. While digging into our camera, we found a reliable way to take over most of the DSLR cameras without exploiting any vulnerability at all. We simply had to ask our camera to do that for us, and it worked.\n\nThis is the first vulnerability research on the Picture Transfer Protocol, a vendor agnostic logical layer that is common to all modern-day cameras. As DSLR cameras are used by consumers and journalists alike, this opens up the door for future research on these sensitive embedded devices.",

With this talk I\u00edll share my current research on Azure privileges, vulnerabilities and what attackers can do once they gain access to your cloud, or how they can abuse your on-premise cloud components. We start with becoming Domain Admin by compromising Azure AD Sync, sync vulnerabilities that allow for Azure admin account takeover and insecure Single Sign On configurations. Up next is cloud roles and privileges, backdooring Azure AD with service accounts, escalating privileges as limited admin and getting past MFA without touching someone's phone. Then we finish with cloud integrations, also known as \"how a developer can destroy your whole infrastructure with a single commit\": Exploring Azure DevOps, backdooring build pipelines, dumping credentials and compromising Azure Resource Manager through connected services.

      "description": "During a classic cyber attack, one of the major offensive goals is to execute code remotely on valuable machines. The purpose of that code varies on the spectrum from information extraction to physical damage. As defenders, our goal is to detect and eliminate any malicious code activity, while hackers continuously find ways to bypass the most advanced detection mechanisms. It\u00eds an endless cat-and-mouse game where new mitigations and features are continuously added to the endpoint protection solutions and even the OS itself in order to protect the users against newly discovered attack techniques.   In this talk, we present a new approach for malicious code to bypass most of endpoint protection measures. Our approach covertly proxies the malicious code operations over the network, never deploying the actual malicious code on the victim side. We are going to execute code on an endpoint, without really storing the code on disk or loading it to memory. This technique potentially allows attackers to run malicious code on remote victims, in such a way that the code is undetected by the victim\u00eds security solutions.  We denote this technique as \u00ecmalproxying\u00ee.",

In doing so, we tested their viability as localised acoustic weapons which could cause temporary/permanent hearing damage and/or adverse psychological effects. We examined a number of countermeasures, including a tool to detect specified frequencies above specified thresholds. \n\nIn this talk, I will cover the background of malware which has, intentionally or not, caused physical or psychological harm.

I will examine the use of imperceptible sound as applied to security research (covert channels, ultrasonic tracking beacons, etc), and will present our experiments and findings, including threat models, methodology, the attacks we developed, and the implications of our results.

Even high-security devices like hardware cryptocurrency wallets use such an architecture. Unfortunately, this arrangement has a history of security bugs due to misconfigured protection hardware, bugs in kernel code, hardware bugs, and side channels.\n\nThis talk proposes a new approach to isolation for devices like crypto wallets: separate the user and kernel onto two CPUs and multiplex processes by completely resetting the user processor between tasks so that there is no leakage.\n\nProcessor reset is more complicated than might be expected. Simply asserting the reset line isn't enough to clear all CPU-internal state, but it turns out that software can be used to clear this state. However, reasoning about the correctness of such code is challenging. This talk presents a tool that can be used to develop and formally verify the correctness of reset code for a given CPU implementation.\n\nThis talk also walks through a design of a wallet based on this reset-based isolation technique, discusses known security vulnerabilities in current designs such as the Ledger and Trezor wallets (including bugs in MPU misconfiguration, system calls, and drivers), and explores how a reset-based design could prevent such vulnerabilities.",

The past four years proved to the entire planet that in the game of intoxicated nostalgic recall, there are no losers and those who won, lost. The DEF CON community has a history of sorts. It is a history is filled with mephitic adventures, quarter-truths, poor life choices, incontinence, and various forms of C2H6O. This year, we will journey to the land of the shadows to extract some of the most celebrated, exaggerated and entertaining moments in Hacker History through the interpretation of a group of well-trained participants. In the end, we will, again, crown the Drunkest Hacker in History and you, the audience, will rejoice! Hosted by c7five & jaku, if you like eating from candy from Japan, deli meat sliced by a sword, Orange Whips, and feats of strength, you won\u2019t want to miss the return of Drunk Hacker History! Presented in DEF CON 4D, 5G, GPRS and made possible by a grant from https://ghost.express. Note: If you arrive early, you might enjoy the festive dancing, music and handfuls of Cinnamon Life cereal.

Slides are not exclusive to technology, they can and will be about anything. Contestants will take the stage and choose a random number corresponding to a specific slide deck. They will then improvise a minimum 5 minute / maximum 10 minute lightning talk, becoming instant subject matter experts on whatever topic/stream of consciousness appears on the screen.\n\nThe Why: \n\nWhether you delight in the chaos of watching your fellow hackers squirm or would like to sacrifice yourself to the Contest Gods, it\u2019s a night of schadenfreude for the whole family. Sign ups will be the day of the contest with some special ways to secure your spot early. \n\nNew This Year:\n\nBattle of Champions! Anyone who has won a version of Whose Slide at other conferences during the last year will compete against our previous Vegas champs in a Slide Slaughter Royale.\n\nGuerrilla Talks.

Our chefs will fill your plate with answers to questions like: Is the questionnaire a painful experience to be dreaded, or an opportunity to make a sale by showcasing your security and privacy practices? How do different organizations answer or vet these forms? Is there such as thing as too much vendor transparency? What best practices can we share, and are there any improvements and scaling hints we can offer? And yes, there are questions you should be asking to better judge security posture and figure out whether security is truly baked in or just a pretty top layer of sugary, flowery icing.",

Although there are various technical solutions for countering ubiquitous facial recognition systems (such as adversarial examples), people are also taking low-tech approaches to defeating them.  In this talk, I will discuss the general concepts needed to understand how to defeat facial detection/recognition systems, how these factors can be leveraged, and provide various examples of how people have already done so.  By talking about how facial detection/recognition systems can be defeated in general terms, I hope to inspire other people to begin exploring this domain.  Or, perhaps, help people to bypass systems that they encounter in their day to day lives.  \n\nThis talk will not be a deep dive in to how the technology works, making it suitable for a wide range of attendees.",

Once running as a service, memhunter starts the collection of ETW events that might indicate code injection attacks.  The live stream of collected data events is feed into memory inspection scanners that use detection heuristics to down select the potential attacks to the one that represents actual fileless threats. The entire detection process does not require human intervention, neither memory dumps, and it can be performed by the tool itself, at scale, improving the threat hunting analysis process and remediation times.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Due to internal environment of Windows domains is always too tolerant, and enterprises are more concerned about border defenses than internal security, the penetration behavior based on Windows Active Directory has become more and more popular and aggressive. The emergence of MicrosoftATA allows BlueTeam to perceive and discover most domain penetration activities, however, there are many bypassing techniques for MicrosoftATA recently, and the detection dimension of MicrosoftATA is not comprehensive enough, especially the persistence part. It's a compelling problem whether the Red Team can ensure their behaviors not to be detected after bypassing the detection of MicrosoftATA. In my recent research, the security event log of domain controller details the activity of entities in the domain. Most AD Attacks leave traces in the logs. These logs can be collected and analyzed in real time, helping you quickly detect attacks before an attacker compromises the domain controller. I will detail how to find exceptional behavior from a large number of domain controller security event logs and use a variety of analysis approaches to determine attacks, while taking into account false alarm rate. It's worth mentioning that we don't collect security event log of all computers, only domain controllers. As a result, these ideas are applicable in a large-scale intranet environment, helping Blue Team build its own Advanced Threat Analytics.\r\n\r\n",

A brief introduction to the structured query language (SQL) used in osquery will be provided. Using this query language, we will learn to extract basic data, and move on to more advanced ways to associate data across subsystems. We will discuss the scheduled query facilities of osquery and how these can be tied into a logging and alerting pipeline. When we have built some familiarity with osquery, we will look at how to utilize these capabilities across the managed infrastructure. We will cover how to manage configurations and live query individual and groups of hosts with Kolide Fleet. The discussion of Fleet will be rounded out with an introduction to the command line interface, with suggestions for how to integrate with automation and source-control workflows.\r\n\r\n",

Perhaps you are familiar with one or more versions that help you derive the risk to your organization (sometimes referred to as residual risk). I have been wondering for a while how to suggest to our industry that there is perhaps TOO much focus on vulnerabilities and not enough attention or focus on the other elements that derive the standard risk equation. The recent disclosure of Meltdown/Spectre introduced a \"perfect storm\" scenario where the vulnerability wasn't easy to patch or fix, and the solution seemed to be break things. This created a situation where the \"security solution\" wasn't simply to apply the patch - and that left many organizations scrambling to figure out how to deal with this example of a persistent vulnerability. This is a great example of what I've wanted to discuss for a while - what else should we focus on in terms of security if/when the vulnerabilities still remain. Interested? Intrigued?

      "description": "Serverless applications have seen a significant rise in adoption in the past year. Along with its advantages, serverless architecture presents new security challenges. Some of these security threats are equal to those we know from traditional application development and some take a new form.\r\n\r\nOne particular example is the Injection attacks. Yes, SQL/NoSQL, OS and Code Injection attacks, they all still exist. But, when dealing with a monolithic application we only have one way in. What happens when we move to serverless architecture and we lose the perimeter? code is no longer executed directly, but is executed through cloud events. Whether it's a file upload, an email sent, a notification received or a simple log entry.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will examine the Serverless #1 risk: Event Injection and will demonstrate injection attacks form multiple event types.",

The generated implants will blend-in as legitimate traffic by communicating to the infrastructure using SaaS channels (e.g. GMail, Twitter). Use your VPS/Domains battery to deploy staging servers and inject your favorite shellcode for interactive sessions, clone sites and hide your implants ready to be downloaded, deploy more redirectors if they get busted\u201a SiestaTime is built entirely in Golang, with the ability to generate Implants for multiple platforms, interact with different OS resources, and perform efficient C2 communications.

      "description": "SaltStack is robust configuration management utility used by many to achieve DevOps related initiatives in their organizations. Thanks to its open source model, SaltStack can be used by both hobbyist, hackers, and corporations alike. Like any open source tool suite out there, that also means individuals with adversarial intent, be it professional, or malicious, can also take advantage of this tool. In its most simple case, SaltStack can be used by an adversary as a simple Command and Control server (C2 server). However, if SaltStack is used as intended, an educated adversary can easily turn salt \u201a\u00c4\u00fabad\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in more ways than simple command and control.\r\nBy re-configuring and automating basic settings within the Salt Master and Salt Minion configurations, it is easy to deploy SaltStack across many systems for any scenario. Coupling this ease of deployment with a basic understanding of configuration management, and scripted stagers, the result is a powerful post-exploitation framework with a built in C2 server, that is simply just SaltStack, but in use by an adversary. There are many benefits for using such a tool suite from an adversarial perspective such as, easily bypassing AV with trusted Salt Minions, and taking advantage of the desired state configurations to build out robust, scalable, post exploitation persistence modules.\r\nPart of the research conducted was not just on how an adversary might use SaltStack, but also on how they might target a SaltStack environment. Man in the middle attacks are a concerning attack vector against Salt Minions at the time of this research. SaltStack has strong protections against this, but they are not enabled by default due to the need of manually distributing a unique public key. It is up to the individual(s) deploying SaltStack to be sure they enabled the proper security features to be safe from these attacks. Fortunately, SaltStack does have a few compensating controls that make this less likely after a successful deployment, but it is important that all SaltStack users are made aware of the importance and impact that just one particular setting can have on their infrastructure. Fortunately methods of detecting this activity are clear and well documented, but unfortunately a successful attack usually means root access on the target which could result in an adversary clearing their tracks. This could make it difficult to perform root cause analysis unless network traffic was analyzed at the time of the event.\r\nThe overall goal of this research is to show how advances in tools for perfectly legitimate Information Technology initiatives, like DevOps, can be turned into sophisticated tool suites for attackers. In true hacker spirit, this technology can be used for completely unintended purposes. This presentation will provide the insight to how SaltStack could be attacked or used in an adversarial context, and also how those attacks or uses could be detected and prevented.",

      "description": "The data center embodies the heart of many businesses on the Internet. It contains much of the information in a centralized location which provides a huge incentive for those who would wish harm. The data centers in the realm of Cloud may no longer contain just a single entity, but many individual tenants that attach to a common fabric. The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) aims to meet these needs with a multi-tenant, scalable fabric that interconnects physical hosts, VMs and containers. ACI is Cisco's answer to the centrally-managed Software Defined Network (SDN). The Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Nexus 9000 series switches form the brains and backbone of ACI. \r\nA member of Cisco's Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) will demonstrate their findings during an evaluation of ACI and the APIC, more than three years before the BH2019 talk \"APIC's Adventures in Wonderland.\" Step into the mind of an attacker and scan, probe, and interact with the network fabric to progress from an unauthenticated user to administrator and root of the data center switch fabric. Once inside the system, see how the APIC can be modified in a nearly undetectable manner to provide the attacker unfettered internal access to all the interconnected hosts and VMs in the data center. The target audience for this talk includes those with a technical interest in offensive discovery and secure product development. Participants will receive an overview of how a data center product is viewed in an offensive light.",

I think most SE talks focus on the more technical \u201chuman\u201d aspects and I\u2019m purposefully ignoring that side.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to focus on the basics; how to perform reconnaissance, how to match dress styles, how to make up a pretext that fits your knowledge, how to get real staff to help you, what to do if you do get in, why you should interact with staff, and why you should practice being observant. These are important tools to learn and use, which can help you make a start in social engineering.",

      "description": "Cold reading is a technique to make others believe that you have psychic powers. After reading everything I could find on cold reading, I ran a two-day experiment during the Veracode Hackathon, where I gave psychic readings to colleagues whom I didn\u2019t know personally. Each participant filled in a survey at the end of the reading, and gave me a short video statement about the experience.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, introduce the concept of cold reading, my experiments, and recommendations for using cold reading techniques in social engineering. I\u2019ll walk through the set up of the experiment, which included setting the scene through props, gauging the \u201csitter\u2019s\u201d level of experience and openness to psychic readings, and then various techniques I applied. These included using statements rather than questions, rainbow ruses based on reading social cues, and playing with probabilities. The talk includes video testimonials and survey results to show the effectiveness of the techniques in the experiment.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll then switch to applying cold reading to social engineering. We\u2019ll cover how props help build your authority if you introduce them in the right way. Using statements rather than questions demonstrates that you are an insider and know the company or situation well, which builds rapport fast. Gauging whether a target is tech savvy helps you tailor your attack. Researching frequently used hardware and software (probability game) and using these in statements can further build your authority. We\u2019ll learn how fortune tellers are never wrong, and how to build justifications so you are always right. Doing OSINT research on your target will help your hit rate, which is what psychics call a warm reading. Before going into questions we\u2019ll cover the following week\u2019s winning numbers for MegaMillions.",

      "description": "Modern aircraft heavily rely on several wireless technologies for communications control, and navigation. Researchers demonstrated vulnerabilities in many aviation systems e.g., injecting ghost aircraft into airspace, spoof locations and manipulate key communication messages. However, the resilience of the aircraft landing systems to adversarial wireless attacks have not been studied in the open literature, despite their criticality and the increasing availability of low-cost SDR platforms. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the vulnerability of aircraft instrument landing systems (ILS) to wireless attacks ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4CpyxYJq4).\r\n\r\nIn majority of airports today, commercial traffic is typically assigned some type of instrument approach into the landing phase to maintain smooth flow of traffic in and out of the airport environment. The demonstrated attacks can cause last-minute go around decisions, missing the landing zone in low visibility, and even cause crash landings depending on the level of automation in the future. We analyze the ILS waveforms and show the feasibility of spoofing such radio signals using commercially-available SDR. We show that it is possible to fully and in fine-grain control the course deviation indicator, as displayed by the ILS receiver, in real-time, and demonstrate it on aviation-grade ILS receivers. Additionally, we introduce a novel attack called the single-tone attack that significantly reduces the power requirements of the attack. We develop a tightly-controlled closed-loop ILS spoofer that autonomously adjusts the adversary\u2019s transmitted signals based on the aircraft\u2019s GPS location to cause an undetected off-runway landing. We demonstrate the integrated attack on an FAA certified flight-simulator\u2019s (X-Plane) AI-based auto-land feature and show success rate with offset touchdowns of 18 meters to over 50 meters. We discuss potential countermeasures and show that unlike other aviation security issues that can be fixed with conventional crypto, they are ineffective against the demonstrated attack and securing ILS poses unique challenges.

Corrupted translators can be the cause of drive failures in drives that appear undamaged and are without physical trauma. That failure can be reversed in many cases. We will present ways to identify if a drive\u2019s translator has been corrupted for the Moose & Pharaoh drive families specifically, how to force a translator rebuild, and open source tool(s) to help you repair the translator.\r\n\r\nData recovery is a notoriously secretive field. Very little information about firmware and its internal data structures is public. Knowledge should be open source. By sharing what we\u2019ve learned we hope to open this field up to more people, encourage repair, encourage re-use rather than disposal of hard drives, and encourage further publicly shared research. After the talk, attendees should be able to fix this type of error themselves in HDDs of the appropriate families using a TTL converter and the supplied code. Familiarity with the basic components of hard drive firmware is helpful, but not required.",

Those systems accomplish basic tasks such as radio, music, navigation and Bluetooth handsfree, but can also embed sophisticated features, using wireless connectivity (with cloud backends) and vehicle bus connectivity. Previous talks have presented some vulnerabilities in the past. This talk will introduce a different approach to compromise embedded infotainment systems, with both software and hardware attacks.\r\n\r\nWhile previous methods focused on OS and network hacking (access to DBus, telnet, firmware update mechanism\u2026), those vulnerabilities do not exist anymore and different approach had to be used, using 3rd party applications. Multiple protections had to be bypassed, such as multiple level of signature (installation package, code-signing), and read-only file systems just to name few. Post-exploitation forensics demonstrated that the vulnerabilities identified would likely be exploited in many different cars.\r\n\r\nHow to proceed to test such systems? What are the steps to compromise infotainment system and what vulnerabilities can be found and exploited?",

With the proliferation of new smart devices with IR-related components, such as face recognition systems, night vision infrared cameras, slow motion cameras, etc., this ancient technology may bring some new attack surfaces.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will demonstrate a new attack scenario. After a COTS security camera is pwned through Internet, the infrared night vision fill light could be flashed to control devices such as TV and AC. In this way, dumb devices that were originally considered to be air-gapped will also face security threats from the network side. With much greater TX power, larger area could be influenced. Additional attack surfaces will also be discussed.\r\n\r\nSecond, we will demonstrate the use of an electric drill and a pure mechanical design similar to a fan blade, constructed as a Spatial Light Modulator. We will demonstrate how to construct a remote control signal that can be recognized by COTS IR remote control from still infrared light. Who said hacking an electric fan doesn\u2019t matter?\r\n\r\nThird, we will analyze the frame structure of an infrared remote control signal by utilizing a smartphone with 960fps \u2018Super Slow-mo\u2019 function as a poor man\u2019s logic analyzer.",

Over time, these technologies became faster, more accurate, and much more affordable. All of these factors, as well as the potential to use AM in production parts and systems, have helped rapidly drive the growth of AM in both industrial and personal uses. Thus, there is a concomitant demand to understand the implications of cybersecurity in this field and these systems. In our research, we show how manufacturers of high-end 3D printers failed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the printed 3D models. Also, our proof of concept demonstrates how network attacks (such as MITM) on 3D printers communication channels can cause a massive impact (such as stealing, replacing or even sabotaging models) on the whole printing process.",

      "description": "In this Talk Stephan will present the latest attack scenarios against modern vessel and yachts.\r\n\r\nWhile modern vessels connected to Internet via SAT-Com or WiFi / GSM Internet Router and the security of the Network is relaying on those devices, this could be interesting, because of NMEA Gateways connecting the Backbone of the Ship with the IP Network. The NMEA backbone (National Marine Electronics Association) is like a CAN Bus in Cars and this bidirectional Gateways are used for communications.\r\n\r\nMarine Routers are sometimes worst, as my research will present a couple of holes in a maritime router model that is common in yachts to get access to the internal network. (CVE-2017-17673)\r\n\r\nTargeting Super or Mega Yachts in harbors or offshore could be a new threat for celebrities, if private informations from onboard are stolen.\r\nOther threat could be to manipulate the Autopilot remotely.\r\n\r\nFinally Stephan will present also SatCom devices with their security holes up to a command line interface.\r\n\r\nAt the end Stephan publish his latest 0-Day against a Satcom Device. Reported under CVE-2018-16114 on 29/8/2018. A PoC script he will release on GitHub.\r\n\r\nThe following Attack scenarios against yachts and vessels will addressed:\r\n\u2013 GPS Spoofing and protection\r\n\u2013 AIS (automatic identification system) spoofing\r\n\u2013 vessel backbone, the NMEA protocol and possible attacks\r\n\u2013 Autopilot\r\n\u2013 internet routers on board\r\n\u2013 entertainment network and systems\r\n\u2013 SatCom\r\n\r\n(HTS Track: Engine Room.

Our new research into 4 different PLC vendor software systems details an almost negligent lack of security standards in modern SCADA environments. This lack of security creates great opportunity for future attackers and the next high-profile attack on industrial control systems. The attack scenario cannot be understated as critical systems such as power, water, transportation, and manufacturing all rely on major PLC vendors in one way or another . We will show a theoretical attack that could have happened using recently discovered vulnerabilities and proof of concept code to disrupt a major power industrial system. We share our observations on vulnerabilities found in vendors across the board and mitigation techniques for using these required software in highly critical environments where even air-gapping is not enough to remove the threat of a remote attacker.",

When you walk into your office and scan your badge, the doors open automatically. During your hospital stay, air pressure is carefully regulated to make sure contaminants stay out or in. In schools and businesses, HVAC systems are managed autonomously to ensure you stay comfortable. Building controllers, a type of industrial control system, are behind these seemingly simple tasks. Like most modern devices, building controllers have become increasingly network and internet-connected, exposing them to a wider range of threats. If malicious actors could take control of access control systems, jeopardize the positive pressure in an operating room, or compromise temperature controls for critical industrial applications, the potential for catastrophic damage is immense. McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) has discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a well known building controller. This is a fully programmable native BACnet\u2122 building controller designed to manage a wide range of HVAC and access control systems. To demonstrate the impact of this attack, ATR has built a simulated datacenter with a fully functioning HVAC system. This talk will demonstrate hacking and controlling this demo unit in real time, along with a discussion of the impact an attack like this can have in the real world.",

With the advent of the IoT, sensors, controllers and many other devices (e.g., surveillance cameras) are available in consumer shops and are being integrated into new and existing smart buildings. These devices are much cheaper than industrial controllers and far easier to install, but they often lack security features and vulnerabilities are discovered with increasing frequency. In addition, bad security practices such as simple or default credentials, unencrypted traffic and lack of network segmentation remain common. In this presentation, we discuss the results of research conducted at Forescout in the past 2 years, including: an analysis of the security landscape for smart buildings with industrial controllers and IoT devices; the development of a proof-of-concept malware using newly discovered and previously known vulnerabilities; and a description of how this can be used by malicious actors in emerging attack scenarios.",

      "description": "Penetration testing helps organizations to quickly identify gaps in their security and detection capabilities that a real-world adversary could use to compromise a targeted environment. The most successful assessments are always the ones in which you can fully engage the customer in your activities. Some in the cybersecurity industry refer to this as Purple Teaming (Red team + Blue team = Purple team). In ICS, the capabilities of the Blue team can vary wildly depending on the level of maturity of the organization. Some customers we work with are able to detect our attacks in real-time and we work with them to fine-tune their ICS detection capabilities. Other customers lack capabilities and are interested in finding as many problems as possible in an effort to secure remediation budget. These teams often join our red team and help provide insider information to maximize our findings. At the very least, constant communication with the customer about what activities are going on and setting the expectation up front that they will be part of the assessment and critical to its success is very important. Customers (usually) understand their network far better than we possibly could within the span of a 1-week engagement, so recruiting them into your penetration testing team is very important. Customers enjoy the experience of taking an adversarial view of their own network and the opportunity to learn from ICS penetration testing experts. Building trust and a stronger customer relationship is often a byproduct of assessment work. In my presentation, I will share some stories about our experience performing assessments and penetration tests against the ICS networks of fortune 500 companies (names have been changed to protect the innocent) and empathize the importance of a collaborative approach to ICS assessments rather than an adversarial one.",

      "description": "Butterfly key expansion (BKE) is a somewhat novel concept to create almost indefinitely new matching public and private keys independently of each other based on a seed (or caterpillar) key pair and a shared expansion function. Although this concept was invented for credential provisioning to Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication devices (DOI:10.1109/VNC.2013.6737583) these characteristics makes it interesting for all low bandwidth, low computational power, low secure storage devices. The BKE protocol allows for efficient generation of massive amounts of certificates with no single PKI component knowing which certificate belongs to which device - as required in V2X communication. The approach has since been utilized and implemented and is about to be standardized in IEEE 1609.2.1. One optimization of the butterfly key expansion protocol is called \"unified butterfly key expansion\" (UBK) (https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/089.pdf), which is about to be included in IEEE 1609.2.1 as well. While learning about this protocol and being involved in the deployment of PKI systems implementing it, I discovered an issue with a scenario where some CAs would implement the \"traditional\" BKE mechanism and other CAs the UBK approach - which is happening, e.g., in the US, where BKE  is already in production and UBK will be soon: the RA in this case could pretend to implement UBK, where in fact it works with a BKE CA. This way the RA could break one of the central privacy characteristics of the butterfly key expansion protocol: no single PKI component is able to know which public keys/certificates belong to the same device.",

      "description": "There is a new ecosystem underway that will impact everyone, especially the irritated people in the U.S. who have received more than 48 billion robocalls last year. This new ecosystem will hopefully put an end to these annoying and fraudulent robocalls calls, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates will constitute more than half of all phone calls placed in the U.S. this year. The FCC and major telecommunications companies including Comcast, AT&T, and T-Mobile are behind a new, global technology standard called SHAKEN/STIR (Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information using ToKENs and Secure Telephony Identity Revisited) to combat robocalls and caller ID spoofing. This new standard addresses the issue of commercial robocallers who are impersonating other callers and committing fraud via Caller ID.\r\n\r\nPublic key infrastructure (PKI) is the backbone of the SHAKEN/STIR global technology standard. In order for the entire ecosystem to work, it needs to be created with a trusted PKI system as the base, using digital signatures in every single call, which are verified and authenticated. SHAKEN/STIR uses digital certificates, based on common public key cryptography techniques, to ensure the calling number of a telephone call is secure. The way it works is each telephone service provider obtains its digital certificate from a certificate authority that is trusted by other telephone service providers. The certificate technology enables the called party to verify that the calling number is accurate and has not been spoofed.  In order to build this new ecosystem to facilitate stronger identities for each and every call generated, an effective PKI ecosystem must be implemented. Strong identities and controls will be needed to ensure call identities are trusted globally. PKI is the technology that will be used to identify and verify each phone call. SHAKEN/STIR will shift the identity details from the call originator to the trusted telephone company routing the call.\r\n\r\nThe industry \u2013 technology infrastructure, telecommunications, and government entities  \u2013  needs to work together on a solution that will reduce fraud and put an end to robocalls. As this technology standard evolves and deployed, it is important to identify the security risks telecommunications companies will face and how enterprises can benefit from this work. Security will be required at every level of SHAKEN/STIR implementation.",

In this talk, I will present Howl, our new open source project and decentralized anonymity network that solves these issues to make DC-Nets usable in the real world. We leverage a new aggregation protocol for bandwidth and fault tolerance issues, and use trusted execution environments (TEEs) to prevent DoS.

This talk will review not only the technical and aesthetic considerations, but also getting over the manufacturing hurdle from design to prototype so you can quickly deploy your fashion hacks to the people",

      "description": "The Third Servile War was over. The slave army has been defeated, and the survivors are offered a pardon by their Roman captors. The only requirement was that they identify Spartacus, their leader (Kirk Douglas). Rather than give away his identity, however, they all begin to yell out \u201cI\u2019m Spartacus!\u201d\u2014thus preserving his anonymity by overwhelming the Romans with possibilities. (Spoiler alert: they all die as a result.) What lesson can we learn from them about preserving privacy through obscurity?\r\n\r\nThe right to be forgotten has been held as fundamental human right by various governments. The recent Facebook scandal and a series of large scale breaches has centered the discussion on the privacy implications of this right. Most people agree that the right to be forgotten should allow users to remove accounts and material that they have created in the past \u2014 but how easy is it to disappear from online social media and networks in an effort to preserve one\u2019s privacy?\r\n\r\nTo find out, I created a fake identity and gave it accounts across 24+ sites, including the \u201cusual suspects\u201d (gmail, twitter, facebook) and some not so \u201cusual\u201d (Ashley Madison and MySpace). The privacy agreements and the experience with these sites demonstrated how difficult deletion is for end users. Governments have not mandated these privacy protections for users systematically\u2014and even if they had, enforcement would be problematic; there is little incentive for businesses to prune existing user data.\r\n\r\nSince users cannot rely on governments to ensure privacy, a different method of privacy assurance is proposed: privacy through obfuscation. Existing accounts and personal data may be protected through obfuscation techniques, common in other research such as location cloaking. An open-source proof-of-concept (\u201cSpartacus as a Service\u201d) is presented that allows for these techniques to be employed on several well-known online applications. This prototype seeks to ensure that privacy is maintained without relying on organizations removing all data from their systems\u2014effectively yelling \u201cI\u2019m Spartacus!\u201d on behalf of the user.",

      "description": "You might have heard the saying, \"Biometrics are usernames, not passwords.\" But outside the security world, most people have no idea of the scale of threats we\u2019re all facing with biometric privacy.\r\n\r\nGovernments worldwide are using facial recognition for surveillance, often leading to disastrous consequences in countries without strong human rights protections. Companies, too, are developing more uses for facial recognition, often with a \u201cMove fast and break things\u201d mindset. Voice data, movement data, and more types of biometric data are also now commonly collected by public and private entities. People willingly put photos, videos, and audio of themselves online. They also use apps and consumer tech that collect biometric data. At the same time, deepfake technology is advancing rapidly, and surveillance culture is becoming increasingly pervasive everywhere.\r\n\r\nNot only are consumers willingly giving up their face data for app discounts, but they\u2019re also giving up their DNA data for questionably accurate genomic analysis. The popularity of DNA testing kits like 23and Me has led to a rise in public and private DNA databases, which come with their own risks, from potential government misuse of data to basic security risks that come with any large-scale collection of sensitive data. \r\n\r\nThe worst possible scenario, of course, is that we create a future where all of these privacy-invasive technologies will succeed and proliferate without laws or technological solutions to stop any of the harms. That\u2019s a world in which we have zero privacy, because your unique and permanent biometric markers are being tracked literally everywhere you go, including, potentially, in your own thoughts. (See. e.g., Facebook\u2019s Reality Labs.)\r\n\r\nBiometric privacy is one of the less-understood fields of privacy research and discussion. In this talk, I explore the unique biometric privacy risks and harms of these new technologies, and offer some solutions for what we can do to protect biometric privacy now and in the future.",

At the same time these kind of applications have become so important that bug buying companies are now paying up to $500,000 for exploits on these platforms or just $15,000 for information disclosure exploits. It is no news that Telegram has been targeted by several intelligence agencies to allow the interception of messages. Several clone applications have been created and distributed with the intent of spying on their users.

Wouldn\u2019t it be ironic if these apps sent your phone number out or didn\u2019t protect your privacy- but rather their own? I inspected the most popular robocall apps from the App Store to see if they truly cared about your privacy. After reading pages of privacy policies (so you don\u2019t have to), I found some interesting things, like phone numbers being sent to at least three different analytics companies, privacy policies being breached in numerous ways, and user data being sent out prior to users accepting the terms of the apps privacy policy.

Perspectives of privacy have been analyzed from five key social worlds within the blockchain industry (users, regulators, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and protocol developers) through semi-structured interviews, conducted in 2018. The study attempts to distinguish the similarities and differences that exist between interdependent groups of agents. Communicating benign and internecine perspectives, ideologies, and approaches to the development of privacy enhancing technologies is viewed as method through which conflict and division may be mitigated against as the industry evolves further into the 21st century.",

      "description": "The human body is the most elegant and complex machine ever created, but often we do not realize how well it works until a major system has been compromised such as with an amputation severing and removing an element of the neuromuscular and skeletal system. There are 1 million annual limb amputations globally, which equates to one every 30 seconds. With those kinds of numbers and what we see in science fiction TV and film, one would expect that prosthetic technology is ubiquitous and advancing at an exponential pace. However, prosthetic technology advancement can be correlated with periods immediately following military conflicts and still not able to fully replicate anatomical function, which is why we are seeking assistance of those at DEFCON\u2019s Biohacking Village to collaborate and help create prosthetic solutions. Wayne Penn, a biomedical engineer and entrepreneur, will be joined by bi-lateral amputee Chuck Hildreth Jr., and Occupational Therapist Laurel Koss to discuss the etiology and epidemiology of amputations, challenges amputees face, the secondary or associated conditions and complications, and their shared experiences while working on advanced robotic prosthetic limb research programs such as the DEKA/DARPA/Mobius Bionics Luke Prosthetic Arm System. Chuck will give a demonstration of the Luke Arm System, the only full powered shoulder down prosthetic arm system in existence. Introductions will be given to the two BHV Prosthetic Labs taking place following the talk and ran by this presentation team. The first Lab will be to create a family of Quick Change Magnetic Adapters for Activities of Daily Living to hold items for personal hygiene as well as items for eating and food preparation utilizing 3D Printing. The second Lab, Thermo Limbs, will be introduced by 7th graders, Piper Vail Lalla and Ava Conlon, who won the Best Idea in the Medical Field and a $20,000 grant for a patent application at the National Invention Convention. This lab will focus on creating microprocessor controlled cooling systems for amputees, as thermal regulation is a major issue that affects amputees with the loss of their major sweat and heat dissipation surfaces.",

      "description": "Forensic Science and Information Security are very parallel fields. They are both methodical in nature and often one area builds succinctly on top of the other. With the ability to have a specialty in various areas, it is interesting that the two do not often merge together and share policies and procedures. You see Forensic Scientists often are called in at the \u201cendpoint.\u201d Usually, it is at the scene of a crime, only giving the final \u201cproduct\u201d and must work backwards to build a story for what initially happened. In Information Security, with the rapid growth of exposure to data, specifically PHI, it is evident that it would be beneficial for both communities to work together. With my area of extended knowledge and expertise in Forensic and Clinical Toxicology, I am often met with various attempts to \u201csocial engineer\u201d me out of patient results to having sent incorrect reports to clients (not on purpose of course). In a Toxicology lab, whether government (local, state or federal) or private, PHI is the utmost important issue. Scientists adhere to the policies and procedures of the SCIENTIFIC aspect of the organization, but not always to the INFORMATION SECURITY aspect of the organization. Let\u2019s chat a little about how to make both industries more aware how they are really Lifetime Lovers and Part-time Friends",

The PirateBox platform with its meshing capability creates this possibility, but somehow has gained little traction. If every WiFi enabled device just became a node on a mesh network, we would have a replacement for the hardware layer of the internet. To show how powerful this platform can be, and take it to the next level, we have created the PegLeg, an implanted cybernetic enhancement that turns the user into an anonymized local area network on which people can chat and share files anonymously, as well as mesh with other nearby networks. The PegLeg differs from a wearable, as it cannot be confiscated, and has no battery. Come learn how you can turn your phone, laptop, raspberry pi, or router into a meshing piratebox, and build a new internet. And if you are really committed, you can build the implant yourself, and be a walking pirate server with a PegLeg.",

      "description": "During this 3 hour workshop you will get the opportunity to work on one of two prosthetic projects:\r\n\r\nProsthetic Workshop #1:\r\nAmputees often have thermal regulation issues, given the loss of major heat dissipation and sweating surfaces and systems coupled with the \u201cradiator\u201d being covered with sockets and additional heat generated by increased energy expenditure and prosthetic electronics. The aim of this lab is to create cooling system prototypes for bi-lateral amputee, Chuck Hildreth, using computer liquid cooling systems, fans, microprocessors, and temperature sensors to help him deal with the Vegas summer heat!\r\n\r\nProsthetic Workshop #2: \r\nActivities of daily living are often more difficult as well as time and energy intensive for amputees. In this lab we will use 3D printing to make Quick Change Magnetic Adaptors that will mount on the end of the prosthesis to hold items for personal hygiene in the bathroom, as well as items for eating and preparing food. Occupational Therapist Laurel Koss and bi-lateral amputee Chuck Hildreth will guide the lab and provide direct feedback. Right tool, right position, ready in a snap!\r\n\r\nPrerequisites: N/A\r\n\r\nWhat to Bring: N/A\r\n\r\nRegistration: https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/bhv-workshop-prosthetics-tickets-65969252811",

      "description": "\"WiFi access point (AP) security is one of the most important aspect when it comes to securing networks. The compromise of a WiFI AP (which mostly also double-up as router in SOHO environments) can lead to several secondary attacks. There are multiple vectors which are used to compromise the WiFi AP ranging from default passwords to sophisticated 0-days. But, after compromising the device, avoiding detection and maintaining access are the most important areas which eventually dictates the impact of the compromise. In this presentation, we will cover how to develop rootkits for WiFi APs to achieve stealth and persistence. We will be using OpenWRT for the demos. We will be covering the following in the presentation: 1. Introduction to OpenWRT 2. OpenWRT architecture and components 3. Understanding the OpenWRT build system 4. Compiling firmware 5. Compiling userspace application 5. Compiling kernel modules 6. Developing and deploying a hello-world rootkit 8. Adding capabilities to hello-world rootkit: a - Hiding itself b - Monitoring System calls c - Resisting kill d - Network stack backdoor 9. Conclusion and Q and A Attendees will get access to cloud based build system lab so they can try out the compilation and tinker if code.\"",

Also, you will be able to apply this knowledge on the spot with some real-life-scenario wifi networks. Some encryptions are mathematically difficult to crack, where the cracking process could take lifetimes. But not to worry, there still are ways to get around this with an attack called Man-in-the-middle (MITM). Be wary! You never know to whom's Internet Access Point you're connecting and who's eavesdropping on you. Ever wondered how to get somebody's passwords of a website?

Wi-Fi devices extend the network boundaries exposing also the network to anyone who is nearby. Reconnaissance is the first and one of the most important phases any attacker will perform. This phase defines the attack surface and the potential targets. This talk will present an overview of IEEE 802.11 reconnaissance based on management frames, showing the internals and how to perform passive & active scan using protocols such as Wi-Fi Simple Configuration, Wi-Fi Direct, Apple AirDrop/AirPlay, Cisco Compatible eXtensions among others. There is a lot of information from devices with Wi-Fi support that can be obtained and it\u2019s in the air for anyone to grab. Even devices connected to secure networks can expose information of the network or the device itself. During the presentation I will show how to use WIG tool to perform information gathering of Wi-Fi devices to get more than a MAC address to identify them. Also I will show some examples of how it is possible to reverse engineering this proprietary protocols.",

      "description": "eduroam networks are designed to provide wireless access to researchers and lecturers around the world. However, it is known that there are now 10,000 eduroam hotspots in 100 countries around the world. eduroam users can access these networks with information such as student numbers, email address, ID number, and special user names. I have done research on these networks and as a result of this research, I have found that eduroam networks are misconfigured in many parts of the world and that eduroam users are forced to mislead. Through this incorrect configuration, we have determined that the user's password information as a clear-text. This way user information can be collected, with the password information obtained, can be accessed to student information systems, e-mail, and computers. As a result of all these researches, we have developed a portable project with the raspberry pi and our own developed tools, so you can collect everything. In this talk, we want to talk about the results of this research with a live demo and share our new project.",

A handheld transmitter is used to control train speed, lights, sound, and trackside accessories. Analysis of this system revealed that the protocol is based on the DCC (Digital Command Control) standard used for powering and controlling trains through conductive track, but instead transmitted over 900-MHz ISM band channels as a continuous FSK stream. Transmitters and receivers both use the popular CC1101, but in asynchronous mode - bypassing its packetization functions.

      "description": "In this talk, I am explaining and releasing v1.0.0 of nzyme after 2 years of work. Nzyme is a new and Open Source WiFi IDS that addresses challenges of wireless security by employing deception techniques, fingerprinting and classic signature-based detection methods. In addition to the IDS part of nzyme, it also parses, enriches and forwards every intercepted management frame to a log management system to allow for long-term WiFi DFIR and even threat hunting. Classic signature-based detection supports alerting on unexpected channels, BSSIDs, SSIDs and crypto options as well as deauthentication frame flooding. Using these techniques can be a good start, but they are so easy to bypass by an attacker that more effort is needed. To take the blue team game to a new level, nzyme allows you to spin up fake networks and alert when an attacker attempts to interact with them. A fingerprinting approach detects common attack platforms like WiFi Pineapples, or ESP8266-based deauthers. The talk includes a real quick introduction to WiFi security with a focus on how signature-based detection is not enough, a live-demo of the web interface and some live detection action. I am explaining the fingerprinting approach in depth, and at the end of the talk, there is a demo of DFIR and threat hunting tasks with the collected data in Graylog.",

The theater was the DEFCON 26 wireless CTF. Since we did pretty well in DEFCON 25's, locating the stationary rogue access point, we hoped to evolve our tactics. We attempted to create a cheap and easy to deploy solution that can be used in the field to track down and locate rogue mobile operators using C2 infrastructure. Utilizing system-on-chip espressif hardware, the espressif SDK, and several open source projects, an extensible wireless mesh command and control software was written to create a framework from which wireless implants could be placed in the field within proximity of one another, and communicated with over a simple Python script running on a raspberry pi as a root node. Once the operator walks through the mesh, the intention is to receive an alert and physically hone in on the rogue AP. https://github.com/joeminicucci/fox_trap",

People make assumptions about how schemes work and believe them to be complicated, yet in many cases the insider knows how simple they are. Most people assume that besides tailgating and social engineering, real break-ins (or physical security testing) are all about picking locks. However, the secret is that on physical pentests it\u2019s typically unnecessary to do that! Some physical controls have known bypasses, and some building contractors (or even locksmiths) don't implement things correctly. Just like Houdini, I\u2019ll be divulging the simple tricks of the trade employed by both criminals and professional physical pentesters to bypass physical controls without using picks.

We've all seen the headlines about storage buckets being open to the public and exposing sensitive information, but what about the permissions we are giving our users and apps that run in our cloud environment? It's becoming more difficult to understand who has permissions over resources and what the implications of those permissions are as more controls proliferate across the public cloud providers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take a closer look at the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) IAM model. You'll be introduced to the relevant concepts to understand the different types of identities, IAM permissions, and scopes. We'll examine the permissions and scopes assigned to the compute engine service account created for you by default. Did you know that the default IAM policy for the compute engine service account includes the ability to impersonate other service accounts, among other things?\r\n\r\nMost importantly, we'll learn how to leverage certain configurations of the service account to escalate privileges from a virtual machine. I will show a demo where I use a shell on a virtual machine to tear down another security control to allow data exfiltration out of the environment. By the end of the talk, you'll understand how to impersonate service accounts, conduct recon, and escalate your privileges from a virtual machine. You'll also get some ideas on how to mitigate against these attacks. ",

On the offensive Mo will share his tools and tactics attacking AWS Infrastructures from Recon to Attacks to Post Exploitation on different services with a focus on Elastic Container Service(ECS). After each attack step, Dani will explain the defensive side and tools and tactics for hardening the AWS Infrastructure from Designing a secure Cloud Architecture to Detection to Hardening specific services like Docker containers on ECS. After the battle, we will both walk-through common misconfiguration problems, one-click solutions for monitoring and attack detection, and workflows for pentesters on AWS. One of the most important lessons from our research is the importance of the interaction between pentesters and developers/DevOps engineers, and how a few days of working side by side can help us secure our current systems and learn to develop future systems with security in mind.\r\n\r\nDani and Mohsan will demonstrate an entire kill chain on a hypothetical organization operating in an AWS environment and pivoting into their internal Active Directory network. The demonstration will cover reconnaissance methods for a cloud environment, an attack on a AWS hosted webserver that results in compromise of access keys. The access keys will be utilized to access a separate AWS service, followed by escalation of privileges to administrator. We will further demonstrate exfiltration methods, setting up persistence in AWS, and last but not least pivoting to the internal AD environment and obtaining Domain Admin privileges.\r\n\r\nMany open source tools will be used as well as some custom python scripts on the offensive side, for example: TruffleHog for scanning for leaked keys on github, S3Scanner for enumerating S3 buckets, amass for DNS Mapping and Subdomain Enumeration, Cloud Mapper for reconnaissance and auditing, Prowler for assessing security, Pacu and Metasploit for exploitation, and more.\r\n\r\nOn the defensive side, we will introduce Open Source tools like HashiCorp Vault and AWS Parameter Store for secret management, NAXSI as an open source WAF, Vulnerability scanners for Docker, AWS KMS for creating and rotating keys for in-transit and at-rest data encryption, CloudTrail and CloudWatch for detection of suspicious activity and alarming, and more.",

      "description": "Azure Sentinel, Microsoft's new cloud SIEM solution, was recently released on the market. Notwithstanding its strengths Sentinel offers limited threat hunting capabilities out of the box and setting up an effective hunting solution is not straightforward. The Sentinel ATT&CK GitHub project is designed to provide guidance on setting up an ATT&CK-driven process monitoring solution within Sentinel; giving DFIR professionals a tool to effectively hunt in the Azure cloud.\r\n\r\nThe project, building on previous work from the open source DFIR community, provides instructions on how to properly configure Sysmon to monitor and detect specific processes in alignment with MITRE's ATT&CK framework. Secondly it provides clarity on how to onboard Sysmon logs from Windows virtual machines, shedding light on some poorly documented areas, while also offering an open source parser to correctly ingest Sysmon data in conformity with the Open Source Security Event Metadata information model. Thirdly it offers around 120 open source Kusto Query Language alerts ready for deployment; each mapped to a unique MITRE ATT&CK technique. Fourthly it provides a dedicated threat hunting dashboard to help DFIR professionals monitor their environment and execute precise hunts. Finally, Sentinel ATT&CK provides ready-made hunting queries to be leveraged when responding to alert notifications raised by the threat hunting dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis talk delivers an overview of how the Sentinel ATT&CK project can help organisations establish an effective threat hunting capability in Azure as well as an opportunity to share with the community the strengths and shortcomings of Sentinel when it comes to hunting adversaries within the Microsoft cloud.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be structured as follows:\r\n- Introductions (2 minutes): A brief introduction to provide our short biographies and a description of our current roles - both speakers\r\n- Project background (3 minutes): An overview of how the project came to be, covering previous Splunk work from the DFIR open source community that helped establish the foundations of Sentinel ATT&CK - both speakers\r\n- The problem (5 minutes): Although Azure Sentinel contains excellent features \u2013 for e.g. threat response automation with Logic Apps (1 minute), a powerful query language (1 minute) and incident grouping (1 minute); the platform offers limited threat hunting capabilities out of the box. Moreover, two major downsides make it difficult to quickly set up a robust, well-structured threat hunting capability; these are a) poor documentation around log onboarding (1 minute) and b) very limited data normalisation features at ingestion time (1 minute) - Edoardo Gerosa\r\n- The solution \u2013 Sentinel ATT&CK (10 minutes): An overview of the project and how it can help with quickly deploying an effective threat hunting solution for Sentinel \u2013 starting with a lighting overview of MITRE ATT&CK (1 minute) , then covering how to configure Sysmon to monitor specific ATT&CK techniques (2 minutes), how to onboard Sysmon logs into Azure (2 minutes), Sentinel parsing best practices (2 minutes), using Kusto to execute hunts (2 minutes) and concluding with an overview of the project's threat hunting dashboard (1 minute) - Edoardo Gerosa\r\n- Demo and Q&A session (10 minutes): we'll showcase a live instance of Sentinel ATT&CK deployed on our Azure lab to walk through the functionalities of the platform, execute a demo hunt and, if necessary, to provide practical deep-dives to participant questions - Olaf Hartong\r\n\r\nIn order to stimulate discussion during the demo and Q&A session we will have three questions in our back-pocket to ask participants; these will be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Who has used Sentinel and what is their opinion of the platform?\r\n- Who uses Sysmon as a process monitoring solution in their network and what is their opinion of the tool?\r\n- What are some of the response activities that could be performed with Sentinel on compromised virtual machines, especially considering the in-built SOAR capabilities of the platform?",

      "description": "PenTesters, Blue & Red teamers, network admins and cloud enthusiasts, this talk will layout from start to finish how to verify the security of your Azure implementation. This talk will be 80%+ demos of where to look, what to do, and how to prioritize what you find. Topics include: Azure Security Center, setting scope, setting policy, threat protection, more.\r\n\r\nDetailed Outline:\r\n\r\nThere are two articles as well as a video we will share at the end to give the audience more information and a checklist of how they can assess their own Azure instances after the talk is over.\r\n\r\nHere is the outline of what we plan to cover in this session:\r\nDo not test the Azure Infrastructure. That is violation of the user agreement for Azure and will get you into hot water with Microsoft. No one wants that.\r\nBe extremely careful to only test things that are IN SCOPE for your client.\r\nIs Azure Security Center turned on? If not, turn it on. I <3 ASC.\r\nDo all subscriptions/sub-subscriptions have it on? Do you have complete coverage? If not, definitely report it.\r\nIs there a policy set (settings that the org has chosen as \"secure\", such as all storage must be encrypted at rest)? If so, what are the settings? Do they look good? Also, what level of compliance do they have? Everything that is not compliant should be reported.\r\nIs threat protection (storage and databases only), monitoring and auditing set up on every possible resource? If not, report it.\r\nLook at the network, in the same way you would look at a traditional network, is anything out of place? Also, are they doing Zoning or Zero-trust or something else? Which network security model are they using? Make sure they are compliant with their own plan. Ask them what their plan is for their network to start. If they don't have an answer, that's another issue altogether.\r\nDo they have \"just in time\" (JIT) set up on all ports on all servers/VMs? Or are they using a JumpBox to access VMs from outside Azure? Or is that not allowed at all? They should use JIT and Network Security Groups (NSGs)for *everything*.Do they have app whitelisting enabled on VMs? It's called Adaptive Application Controls, and it's right underneath JIT in the security center (ASC) menu, under \"Advanced Cloud Defense\". They should have that turned on for *all* servers.Are they using a SIEM (Security incident and event management system)? Are they using it well? Are they monitoring it? What kind of coverage is it getting? Does ASC feed into it? It should.\r\nAre they using a WAF (Web Application Firewall)? If so, test it. If they aren't, mark it as advice for improvement.Any other 3rd party security tools (IPS/IDS/HIPS/Other)? If so, are those getting complete coverage of all assets that are covered by this test? And are they configured well?\r\nLook in \"Recommendations\" tab of Azure Security Center and it will tell you all the problems (network issues, config errors, missing patches, more) that you haven't spotted yet. :) Really, you could likely start here. This is a list of everything that is not compliant with your policy, in order of importance.\r\nIf you are assessing web apps within Azure, APIs and functions (serverless), that's a whole other topic, but all of the regular security testing rules would apply, Azure or not.\r\nIf your org is using Azure DevOps I suggest adding several security tests to your pipeline including Azure Secure DevOps Kit. It's strict; you likely won't pass the first few times around, so prepare your developers for a bit of disappointment. There are a TON of great security tools in the Azure Marketplace, add a few, one is not enough.Turn on VA for SQL DataBases as part of the Azure Threat Protection, and kick off a scan right away to see if anything is happening. It will likely had a lot of advice for you.\r\nLook in the Threat Detection part of Security Centre, verify that there are no active attacks happening or recent ones, investigate accordingly.",

Companies both large and small are moving workloads to the cloud and are very concerned with how to secure their resources which actually live in AWS, GCP, and Azure. However, they don't address how enabling this access changes their internal attack surface and weakens their defenses.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we demonstrate that attackers no longer have any reason to rely on conventional CNC, being able to outsource their costs and infrastructure management to the likes of Slack, Github, Pastebin, Dropbox, Google, and social media sites. Using these sorts of techniques, URL blacklisting becomes obsolete, IDS becomes less effective, and attackers no longer have to waste their time writing domain generation algorithms.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I will demo a proof-of-concept malware which uses multiple SaaS services, social networks, and more conventional \"cloud infrastructure\" (S3) that would be extremely difficult to mitigate generically with today's IPS solutions, and we discuss how the same techniques can be used by red teams and attackers to quietly maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.",

      "description": "Cloud. It's the land of opportunity. Enterprises are doing mass migrations from older and legacy systems to harness greater power and efficiency from innovative new tech. Following that money trail are opportunistic attackers, seeking the computing strength and near-invisibility afforded by enterprise cloud environments to mine bitcoin. Cryptominers are everywhere. And yes, Virginia, they are in the Cloud.\r\nThese nebulous power-rich realms let attackers set up mining rigs to feast on enterprise resources, while flying below the detection of cloud or conventional security resources. The concern here is that once attackers gain access to our networks, they can pivot and move laterally, to find even greater reward in the vast amounts of data available.\r\nLet's talk about what we do and don't know when it comes to securing our cloud environments against malicious miners. Because it isn't just a question of what they can take \u2013 it's about the payloads they can leave behind.\r\nIntroduction: (5 min)\r\n\u2022 Enterprise and Cloud: If you work for a major organization, you're probably undergoing or have just gone through a major migration to the Cloud. This is the big push according to a recent Gartner report, with 37% of enterprises reporting it as their top priority, and ranking at 39% for CIOs, ahead of cybersecurity (why are we not surprised).\r\n\u2022 An Evolution of Evil: the rise of miners. Easy to get into. Low bar for entry. Starter toolkits cost $30 online. Cryptojacking increased by 4000% in 2018.\r\n\u2022 Major miners like XMRig\r\n\u2022 Main attack vectors: brute force credentials for access; leverage multiple vulnerabilities for access and movement internally.\r\n\u2022 Motivation: almost 100% return on investment. No overhead\r\nMiners in the Sky: (5 min)\r\n\u2022 Why it's expected to continue\r\no The return on investment is lucrative in terms of computing power\r\no Lack of detection\r\n\u2022 Most organizations don't have mature cloud security programs. By design, yes, in reality \u2013 not so much. Cloud has huge amounts of processing power with built-in auto-scaling\r\n\u2022 attackers can operate with almost no detection\r\n\u2022 The bigger the account, the longer attackers can go\r\n\u2022 Enterprises are migrating to the Cloud. We love our containers: Docker, AWS, Azure.\r\nCharting the rise of malicious miners in cloud environments by attacks: (10 min)\r\nOverview of what we're seeing:\r\n\u2022 attacks on containers and container management\r\n\u2022 control panel exploitation\r\n\u2022 theft of APIs\r\n\u2022 spreading malicious Docker images\r\n\u2022 leveraging current and older enterprise vulnerabilities\r\n\u2022 EternalBlue\r\nLet's Start Here: The attack on Tesla's AWS S3 public cloud in February 2018. Researchers at RedLock found mining malware from a wide-spread, well-concealed cryptomining campaign in Tesla's AWS cloud. RedLock found it when they scanned public internet for misconfigured and unsecured cloud servers \u2013 there's been a few of those. They saw an open server. Further investigation revealed it was running Kubernetes, the open source admin console for cloud application mgmt., which was doing cryptomining. The Kubernetes console was not password protected. The attackers found login credentials for Tesla's AWS in one of the pods. They went from there to deploy malware scripts for Stratum bitcoin mining.\r\nAbusing exposed Docker APIs: Hundreds of vulnerable and exposed Docker hosts were abused in cryptojacking campaigns in March this year. Attackers exploited CVE-2019-5736, a runc vulnerability identified in February, that could trigger a container escape. Now, that kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a container when it means the attacker can access the host filesystem and overwrite the runc binary to run arbitrary commands on the host. Attackers scan for exposed Docker APIs on port 2375. They deployed malicious self-propagating Docker images infected with malware to load Monero miners and find other vulnerable targets via Shodan. External access to API ports will enable attackers to gain ownership of the host. They can tamper with instances running inside, drop malware, access user's servers and resources. Discussion point: Misconfiguration is prevalent \u2013 why? How can we help users do this better?\r\nUninstalling Cloud Security: A new cryptomining malware family that targets Linux servers gained admin rights on systems by uninstalling cloud security products. We'll talk about the Chinese-language threat actor behind this and other attacks, Rocke group. Consider how nation-state adversaries and advanced persistent threats (APTs) could seek to leverage this kind of attack in sophisticated campaigns.\r\nDiscussion point: We've seen conventional malware evade and disable existing AV. If we can't detect it, how do we protect against it? How are we extending this to malware targeting Cloud?\r\nTargeting Elasticsearch servers: in the \"Cryptosink\" campaign, attackers exploit a five year old vulnerability that could lead to executing arbitrary Java code, CVE-2014-3120, that affects Elasticsearch running on both Windows and Linux platforms. They download malware that has not been detected by AV on Linux. The attackers backdoor the servers for future access, eliminate competitors on the infected system by redirecting their mining pool traffic to a sinkhole, and achieve persistence by replacing the Linux remove command.\r\nWhat else could be at risk: Abusing instant metadata API. This functionality is offered by all cloud providers. If it isn't secured or monitored well, and attacker can exploit it via vulnerable reverse proxies or malicious Docker images.\r\nWhat could this lead to: Once attackers are in your network, they aren't limited to just mining Monero. They have access to all your data-rich environments. If the attacker is looking for satisfaction that money can't buy, yes they can deliver a very damaging payload with ransomware or worse. Think NotPetya.\r\nReview of Vulnerabilities & Exploits: (5 min)\r\n\u2022 Misconfiguration: security researcher and attackers are actively seeking and finding many exposed and unsecured instances online. Human error is at the brunt of things, but Cloud isn't traditional infrastructure. It's a complex, dynamic network that requires specialized knowledge and training to do configuration right.\r\n\u2022 EternalBlue: believe it. There are still plenty of unpatched instances out there and attackers continue to leverage this exploit to gain access, spread and move laterally within networks\r\n\u2022 Oracle WebLogic vulnerability CVE-2019-2725: There have been a series of critical vulnerabilities in this popular enterprise software\r\n\u2022 Remote code execution: Miners have been using a group of vulnerabilities for RCE as initial access and more\r\no CVE-2012-0874: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Multiple Security Bypass Vulnerabilities.\r\no CVE-2010-1871: JBoss Seam Framework\r\no JBoss AS 3/4/5/6: CVE-2017-10271: Oracle WebLogic wls-wsat Component Deserialization RCE\r\no CVE-2018-2894: Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware.\r\no Hadoop YARN ResourceManager - Command Execution\r\no CVE-2016-3088: Apache ActiveMQ Fileserver File Upload\r\n\u2022 PSMiner targets known vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch, Hadoop, PHP, Oracle WebLogic\r\n\u2022 Fake certificates: attackers increasingly use this to evade detection and infiltrate conventional systems. How can we apply what we're learning to protect in the Cloud?\r\nWhat we can do: (5 min)\r\n\u2022 Countermeasures:\r\no rotate access keys\r\no restrict outbound traffic\r\no cryptojacking blockers for Web browsers\r\n\u2022 Monitoring user behavior\r\n\u2022 Follow the principle of least privilege when issuing credentials\r\n\u2022 EternalBlue is still actively leveraged against vulnerable systems. Think third party compromise\r\n\u2022 Visibility. Be able to see down to the process level.\r\n\u2022 Micro-segmentation to control lateral movement and spread\r\n\u2022 Apply, monitor and enforce best practices\r\n\u2022 Resources like Yara rules to detect miners (will make available)\r\n\u2022 Unusual deletions or spinning up containers\r\n\u2022 IoCs\r\nConclusion and Q&A",

      "description": "Cloud services are built for increased collaboration and productivity, and provide capabilities like auto sync and API level communication. This has led enterprises to exclusively use SaaS, PaaS and IaaS services for storing and sharing critical and confidential data. End users as well as security products tend to place implicit trust in cloud vendors such as Microsoft, AWS, Google, and SaaS app vendors such as Box, Salesforce, DropBox. As a result, cybercriminals have started launching their attacks from these trusted cloud services. This talk will focus on how attackers are abusing these trusted cloud services to create Phishing attacks that are highly effective and hard to detect.\r\nWe will begin the presentation by sharing some statistics that illustrate the wide-scale adoption of cloud services by cybercriminals. In particular, we focus in on the usage of cloud services as a launching point of an attack. In the next section, we will discuss some of the novel, offensive phishing techniques that the attackers have employed, including: abusing SaaS APIs, abusing trusted API redirects, and hosting attack pages in cloud services.\r\nWe will deep dive into three specific techniques we discovered in the wild:\r\nTargeted BEC (Business email compromise) - phishing attacks abusing popular services like S3, GCS, Azure Storage, and GCP Google's App engine. The S3, GCS, and Azure Storage based attacks used static web hosting to serve up convincing baits, complete with Amazon, Google, or Microsoft issued SSL certs. We will provide a few examples of some successful attacks of this type. The App Engine attack used an open redirect to make it appear that the bait was being delivered from Google. We provide a detailed breakdown of how this was done and what made this attack successful. At the time of writing this draft, Google shows its standard redirection notice when users click on one of these AppEngine links, making it more obvious to the user that they are being redirected.\r\n\"Default Allow\" action in popular PDF readers and Annotations used in themed decoy templates. This action only warns the user that it is trying to connect to a trusted cloud service, which looks benign at face value. By taking advantage of the \"default allow\" action in popular PDF readers, the attacker can easily deploy multiple attacks without getting the security warning after the first alert. In this section, we provide examples of multiple attacks leveraging this techniques, including the preceding BEC.\r\nPhaaS(Phishing-as-a-Service): Criminals hosting a full-fledged phishing infrastructure over cloud and selling it as a B-to-C model. These on-demand service based models provides an essence of a criminal version of software-as-a-service which allows purchasing site login accounts along with crafting and hosting phished links. In this section, we provide an overview of one of these services and describe how it is using public cloud services to drive its success.\r\nThe idea is to educate our audience about the new wave of sophisticated attacks abusing highly trusted services like Google and its App engine APIs, object stores in AWS/Azure/GCP and other Tier-1 SaaS applications. The attackers not only craft a \"near original\" phishing bait but also make it hard for security products to detect such attacks.\r\nWe will then discuss some inherent design constraints and weaknesses in these services which are benefiting the cybercriminals in creating attacks to bypass modern day security solutions. Most end users are savvy enough now to understand that links that include random IP addresses or suspicious sounding domain names should not be clicked on, but they don't have a similar awareness of risk associated with cloud services. Users tend to click on an email invite from a cloud application or a phishing document hosted in a cloud environment as it is convincing and difficult to recognize as phishing.\r\nWe will then understand the motivation behind this new trend, its monetary impact in the cybercrime market and its simplicity, which is appealing more and more novice cybercriminals into building their attack surfaces by abusing such services.\r\nWe will conclude the talk by sharing details about our responsible disclosure to tier 1 vendors and proposing detection and remediation techniques for such type of attacks ",

Typical Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) does not lend itself well to Purple Team practices. This talk covers the basics of conventional Purple Team exercises, the ways that application testing environments and tools often differ from penetration testing, and how application defenders and breakers can adapt to those differences to enable each other in an integrated fashion. \r\n\r\nFor defenders, learn how your insights into the overall environment and risks, knowledge of security controls, and the state of and output from applications being tested can lead to better, faster, and more actionable application security tests. For breakers, learn how to help defenders better recognize threats in logs and alerting systems and increase their ability to spot, stop, and mitigate real-world attacks. Both sides can benefit from fewer missed opportunities to work together to increase the security of their organization while reducing the friction that the often adversarial nature of security testing creates.

It will also teach you real world penetration testing techniques.  Come sign up to work through 3 CTF challenges.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nElection Hacking by Voting Village\r\n\r\nThe Voting Village will give r00tz hackers the opportunity to alter political candidates\u2019 campaign finance contributions on simulated Secretary of State websites. This challenge will offer kids insight into yet another critical element within the election lifecycle and, in concert with the AI village, demonstrate how altered data can sow the seeds of disinformation social media campaigns. The purpose of this challenge is to educate and, hopefully, foster a notion of civic engagement as this generation becomes the next generation of voters.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLockpicking Competition by Amazon\r\n\r\nr00tz hackers will get the opportunity to apply their newly acquired lockpicking skills.  Amazon will be offering timed challenges for lockpickers.  In this exciting lab, you\u2019ll have 90 seconds to pick the lock to win a prize.

Mentors will be available to help beginners throughout the duration of the event.\r\nCompete for awesome prizes and learn new security skills in this computer-based competition. Players will work on teams to earn points and gain control of the game map by completing both defense and offense challenges.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nChallenge Accepted - Hacking for Fun and (Legal) Profit by Synack and Point3 more\u2026\r\n\r\nLevel up your hacking skills with hands-on challenges to introduce you to security training and ethical hacking. All levels welcome!\r\n\r\nExperts from the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity will walk you through recon and exploit concepts using hands-on techniques. We\u2019ll run through analytics to detect malicious cyber activity and hands-on labs to conduct attacks with actual penetration testing tools and real-world \"hacks\" on a live system. Get ready to go through the steps of footprinting/scanning, enumeration and attack. Point3 instructors will show how weaknesses are found and Synack ethical hackers will explain how found weaknesses can be used for exploits.\r\n\r\nThree challenges, with a range in difficulty, are available for participants:\r\n\r\n1:00 PM - 2:30 PM - Network (Intermediate) - A short overview of how TCP works explaining why we care about how computers use that protocol. How everyone uses it and why we as security researchers need to be prepared to analyze network data.  \r\n\r\n2:30 PM - 4:00 PM - Window Decompiling (Advanced) - Pick apart a Windows compiled program and find out where and why data obfuscation and secure programming is important. |  Web Attacks 101 (Beginner) - Learn the basics about web hacking. Beginners encouraged!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nr00tzBook Misinformation CTF by AI Village\r\n\r\nMisinformation is a rapidly-emerging threat to public discourse on key issues. Increasingly, the next public forum is located in our digital neighborhoods and communities. Two-thirds of American adults get at least some of their news on social media. Yet on the Internet, not everyone is who they claim to be.\r\n\r\nTech companies are scrambling to fix the online misinformation problem. Due to the sheer scale of online activity, researchers leverage machine learning techniques to help attack the problem. These approaches have limits, and must adapt to a constantly-changing threat landscape\r\n\r\nThe AI Village has built a hands-on red team vs. blue team misinformation CTF on a closed-course, simulated social network. Participants will:\r\n\r\n- Create bots to disseminate a message, and see the social network changes in real time. Learn how bots can be responsibly used on social media networks.\r\n- Learn about spam filters that use a variety of machine learning techniques, including anomaly detection and natural language processing.\r\n- Generate bot behaviors to attempt to evade spam filters, experiencing the adversarial nature of the CTF.\r\n- Learn about ethics and best practices from volunteer instructors.\r\n- Read more about the workstation here: https://aivillage.org/blog/2019/7/31/r00tzbook-a-misinformation-ctf-for-kids\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you at r00tz to train the next generation of cybersecurity experts and informed Internet users.\r\n",

These approaches have limits, and must adapt to a constantly-changing threat landscape\r\n\r\nThe AI Village has built a hands-on red team vs. blue team misinformation CTF on a closed-course, simulated social network. Participants will:\r\n\r\n- Create bots to disseminate a message, and see the social network changes in real time. Learn how bots can be responsibly used on social media networks.\r\n- Learn about spam filters that use a variety of machine learning techniques, including anomaly detection and natural language processing.\r\n- Generate bot behaviors to attempt to evade spam filters, experiencing the adversarial nature of the CTF.\r\n- Learn about ethics and best practices from volunteer instructors.\r\n- Read more about the workstation here: https://aivillage.org/blog/2019/7/31/r00tzbook-a-misinformation-ctf-for-kids\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you at r00tz to train the next generation of cybersecurity experts and informed Internet users.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nTeach a Computer by Cecilia & Alan\r\n\r\nThis workstation gives r00tz hackers a taste of machine learning using three short image recognition and text classification projects. Teach a computer to recognize your face and chat with you, then try to fool it!\"\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nDigital Privacy Detectives by Caroline D. Harding and Jen Dalsen\r\n\r\nYour friend is careful with their Facebook privacy settings and is diligent about using strong passwords. They are also thoughtful about what type of photos they take and post online. Despite all this, an embarrassing photo of them was emailed to everyone in their social circle. Now, your friend is convinced their life is ruined. Gather clues from four different \u201crooms\u201d using an interactive computer story to figure out who is responsible for posting the photo, how you can support your friend, what they should do next, and how to keep this from happening again.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nDrone Warz by Erin Patrick Owens\r\n\r\nDrones are exciting for kids and the next generation of pilots will likely work in these fields in greater numbers than traditional pilots. These STEM programs focusing on drones encourage kids to kinetically interact with technology while learning how adaptations can be applied for functional use. Attendees will learn remote camera functions and setups, real flight controllers, simulated flights and drone functions, and fun and exciting adaptations.\r\n\r\nThis workstation will engage kids in:\r\n\r\nReal Drone Gameplay with VR integration and high score award winners.Building kits for small drones available for instructional construction and operation.using 3-5 Drone and rf aircraft flight simulator stations and Demonstrating the new wireless assault drone will be unveiled.",

Most end-users have no idea what kind of information their devices are storing and how to securely clean their devices (if that even is possible). Lets explore together what the risks are and how we can extract that data.\r\n\r\nMany IoT devices collect a lot of data and log files. Of course, most of this data is sent to the Cloud. However, often this data is also stored locally on the device and never deleted in the lifetime of those devices, not even on a factory reset (in contrast to Smart Phones nowadays). This might surprise many people, and especially end users might not be aware of that. Due to the design of IoT devices, there is usually no real way, like for notebooks or PCs, for end users to clean the devices before they sell them on eBay or discard them. The devices may hold sensitive information like Wi-Fi credentials, nearby access points, cloud communication log files, maps, or audio samples.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show some examples of interesting IoT devices from various vendors and how to extract the corresponding information.\r\nWe will use software methods (rooting) and hardware methods (flash dumping). Using this information, I will show how I am able to find the original owner of the device.

We'll start with a quick 'n dirty crash course for those just getting started with IoT hacking, a brief glimpse into the current status of IoT botnets and get down to business with showing our research on a few popular IoT brands with demos for each finding. Worth mentioning that some of the vulnerabilities haven't been patched at the time of this submission (6 months after our initial report to the vendor) so odds are that we'll be popping some connect-back shells from cameras behind NAT live, on stage.",

Note: despite how critical security flaws are, they will be not fixed by the manufacturer. \r\n\r\nFirst, the talk will go over the how to dump the source code from the Zyxel NAS 326, as well as understanding the organization of the device. Once we understand how the device works, we will dive into 4 independent bugs discovered on the NAS: including two remote code executions bugs (RCE) and an arbitrary file move. All of the bugs will have a step-by-step walkthrough of how they were discovered and how to exploit them with live demos.",

      "description": "HDMI is used by many display devices as an interface for transmitting high-definition video and audio data. The HDMI usage rate is expected to increase further as many global IT companies such as Samsung, Google, and Apple are joining the HDMI Forum. HDMI is provided for transmitting digital television audiovisual signals from HDMI source device to the HDMI sink device. It delivers not only the audiovisual signal but also controls, status and data information in both directions. Although there is a weakness that HDMI requires a direct line connection, considering the HDMI usage rate of AV devices, the impact of HDMI vulnerability is huge.\r\n So we will explain the CEC and DDC protocols that transmit bidirectional data in detail and explain the reason why they are considered as attack vectors. Simply put, CEC protocol is used to control devices connected to HDMI. The DDC protocol is used by the HDMI source device to obtain information about the status and function of the HDMI sink device. In particular, we will talk about the structure of each protocol's messages and how we sent them. After that, we will introduce the fuzzer we made and release the source code of it. There are CEC fuzzer with USB-CEC adapter, DDC fuzzer with our own test cable, and DDC fuzzer of Ubuntu graphics driver. And I will present about the vulnerabilities which we found in the set-top box as a result of our fuzzer, and the crash we got from Windows. If we find something else, we'll disclose it also.",

Unfortunately we see lots of EV charging points connected to the internet.

As an example, the vulnerabilities found on a specific Electrical Vehicle Charging Point will be presented during this talk. This talk will cover the findings that disclosed already[1] and fixed, and also cover a quite straightforward denial of service and remote code execution vulnerability that does not acknowledged and fixed by the vendor.\r\n [1]: https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-305-03",
