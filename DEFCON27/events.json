There is one nice implication that might justify the increased complexity and other possible gripes:  Compared to a normal password, a combo password of the same length has far more possible combinations. This effect is increasing with password length and the number of usable keys. With three available keys and a length of two there are 9 combinations for normal passwords and 15 for combo passwords. Increasing the length to three we get 27 vs 69 combinations.  This could lead to less strict password requirements while increasing the security.  The goal of this project is to develop a free standard, a browser plugin for using combo passwords in regular login forms and implementations for popular languages, frameworks and PAM.  Visit Demo Labs and try to break a real hackers password, there will be a small reward for the fastest brute force tool!",

These tools will be used by penetration testers or security researchers to identify IoT services and verify security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Currently available tools used for security testing, like nmap or OpenVAS, do not support all new IoT protocols.  So possibilities to test IoT products and discover such devices in tested networks are limited.  We are working to fill this gap with Cotopaxi toolkit. Main features of our toolkit are: - Checking availability of network services for supported IoT protocols at given IPs and port ranges (\"service ping\"), - Recognizing the software used by remote network server (\"IoT software fingerprinting\") based on responses for given messages using machine learning classifier, - Discovering resources identified by given URLs (\"dirbusting\"), - Performing black-box fuzzing of IoT protocols based on corpus of packets prepared using coverage-based fuzzer,  - Identifying known vulnerabilities in IoT servers, - Detecting network traffic amplification. New features in release for Defcon27 are: - client-side versions of protocol fuzzer and vulnerability tester, - support for new protocols: SSDP and HTCPCP.",

      "description": "CSTC is a Burp Suite extension for various input transformations. It implements a generic solution that can replace numerous specialized extensions.  The CSTC solves the problem of having too specific burp plugins by being a more generic problem solving tool. It contains a wide range of very simple operations that can be chained into complex transformations. This allows a penetration tester to create the exact transformation they need to test a specific product without having to write any code. As we all know, writing code and setting everything up is time consuming.  You can configure complex input transformations for both requests and responses simply by using drag and drop. You can calculate HMACs for parts of the request, refresh timestamps, update sequence numbers or encrypt parts of the request. You can chain together different operations to create more complex transformations. You could extract parts of the request, decompress them, insert your payload using the repeater or utilizing the scanner and put it back in and compress it again before sending it. Since there are already many basic operations implemented, you can easily focus on testing the application instead of searching for extensions performing such transformations.",

There are a number of tools to uncover subdomains an organization is exposing, but individually they do not give you the complete picture. In the event that you use multiple tools, you are given an overwhelming amount of data to piece together into an aggregate view. In this talk we introduce Dr.ROBOT, a domain reconnaissance tool that was developed to run a large variety of subdomain enumeration tools. It was designed to trivially incorporate new tools as they are released by leveraging Docker and Ansible. Dr.ROBOT has three stages: gathering, inspection, and publishing. In the gathering stage, it gathers as much information as it can and aggregates the results. In the inspection phase, it captures screenshots and other information regarding the target. Finally, in the publishing phase it sends the data gathered during the previous two phases to an endpoint for manual review. Dr.ROBOT was created to serve as a comprehensive source on subdomain exposure by gathering information from as many resources as possible. It is a versatile utility for bug bounty hunters, blue teams, red teams, and many others.",

By pinpointing the exact OS of a host, an attacker can launch an educated and precise attack against a target machine.  There are lot of reasons to hide your OS to the entire world:  Revealing your OS makes things easier to find and successfully run an exploit against any of your devices. Having and unpatched or antique OS version is not very convenient for your company prestige. Imagine that your company is a bank and some users notice that you are running an unpatched box. They won't trust you any longer! In addition, these kind of 'bad' news are always sent to the public opinion. Knowing your OS can also become more dangerous, because people can guess which applications are you running in that OS (data inference). For example if your system is a MS Windows, and you are running a database, it's highly likely that you are running MS-SQL. It could be convenient for other software companies, to offer you a new OS environment (because they know which you are running). And finally, privacy; nobody needs to know the systems you've got running. OSfooler was presented at Blackhat Arsenal 2013. It was built on NFQUEUE, an iptables/ip6tables target which delegate the decision on packets to a userspace. It transparently intercepted all traffic that your box was sending in order to camouflage and modify in real time the flags in TCP/IP packets that discover your system.  OSfooler-NG has been complete rewriten from the ground up, being highly portable, more efficient and combining all known techniques to detect and defeat at the same time:  Active remote OS fingerprinting: like Nmap Passive remote OS fingeprinting: like p0f v2 Commercial engines like Sourcefire\u2019s FireSiGHT OS fingerprinting Some additional features are:  No need for kernel modification or patches Simple user interface and several logging features Transparent for users, internal process and services Detecting and defeating mode: active, passive & combined Will emulate any OS Capable of handling updated nmap and p0f v2 fingerprint database Undetectable for the attacker",

Not only does this allow you to dynamically access all of the .NET API from a scripting language of your choosing, but it also allows you to still remain completely in memory and has a number of advantages over traditional C# payloads! Essentially, BYOI payloads allow you to have all the \"power\" of PowerShell, without going through PowerShell in anyway!

      "description": "Do you feel safe in your home with the security system armed? You may reconsider after watching a demo of our new hacking toolkit, ZigDiggity, where we target door & window sensors using an \"ACK Attack\". ZigDiggity will emerge as the weapon of choice for testing Zigbee-enabled systems, replacing all previous efforts.  Zigbee continues to grow in popularity as a method for providing simple wireless communication between devices (i.e. low power/traffic, short distance), & can be found in a variety of consumer products that range from smart home automation to healthcare.   Unfortunately, existing Zigbee hacking solutions have fallen into disrepair, having barely been maintained, let alone improved upon. Left without a practical way to evaluate the security of Zigbee networks, we've created ZigDiggity, a new open-source pentest arsenal from Bishop Fox.  Updates include migration to better hardware for testing (e.g. SDRs), and a slew of newly implemented Zigbee attacks types.  Our DEMO-rich presentation showcases ZigDiggity's attack capabilities by pitting it against common Internet of Things (IoT) products that use Zigbee. Come experience the future of Zigbee hacking, in a talk that the New York Times will be hailing as \"a veritable triumph of the human spirit.\" ... ya know, probably",

In this workshop, participants will hack apps from Wells Fargo, Microsoft, Lyft, WhatsApp, Whole Foods, IBM, Harvard, Progressive, the Indian government, and other large organizations. We will find insecure network transmissions, broken cryptography, improper logging, and pervasive lack of binary protections. We will also analyze the way iOS apps use network transmissions, and observe serious vulnerabilities in iOS apps from major companies.\n\nWe will analyze Android internals in details, using the Drozer attack framework to inspect and manipulate intents to exploit insecure activities and content providers. We will perform a protection level downgrade attack on an Android 4.3 device, removing security protections from the Twitter app.\n\nAll class materials are freely available on the Web, and will remain available after the workshop.

      "description": "Layer 2 can be a lesser-known attack surface; the techniques have been known for a while, have well-documented mitigations, and are often thought of as so old, they _can't possibly still be around, right?_ \n\nBut this under-represented attack surface is also of great value to an attacker. Network segregation on a typical internal network is commonplace, and often heavily relied upon to segregate, isolate, and limit the spread of a compromise. A misconfigured switch or switch port can be the difference between an attacker compromising the desk phones, and core business server infrastructure. And when the misconfiguration can be a single two-word line in a ten-thousand line switch configuration file, it's easy to see how the basic hardening controls can be missed.\n\nThis workshop will run through analysing Layer 2 network traffic, identifying protocols and information of interest within network traffic, launching DTP attacks to pivot within a misconfigured network, and man-in-the-middling traffic via this pivot to compromise a target host (including using various tools in conjunction with virtual network interfaces). In terms of tooling, we will be looking to utilise the likes of Wireshark, Yersinia and Bettercap to launch the various network attacks, with standard Kali tooling/normal Linux functionality to exploit and escalate privileges on the target host. \n\nReading list (not required, but can be of interest):\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_arp/configuration/15-mt/arp-15-mt-book/arp-config-arp.html\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960/software/release/12-2_53_se/configuration/guide/2960scg/swvlan.html\nhttps://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/vlan-tagging-explained-with-dtp-protocol.html\nhttps://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/bh-us-02-convery-switches.pdf\nhttps://digi.ninja/blog/abusing_dtp.php",

      "description": "This is an introduction to functional programming concepts. It's not an intro to a language or a tool, but to a set of ideas. It's a powerful one for any hacker to learn, but especially for blue teamers who find themselves writing or maintaining increasingly complex code. Practicing it can help defenders write safer code that scales well.\n\nWhy speak particularly toward blue team? \n\nDefenders are often unsung heros today. Blue teamers, like system admins, may find themselves writing code to glue things together, fill in the gaps between existing tools, or make up for lack of tools altogether. If your codebase evolves into a critical system, the work of managing its rising complexity can become a serious challenge. Defense is hard, and studying the esoterics of software architecture can be a rare luxury (or an exercise in frustration, depending on your situation.) This workshop aims to hand you the distilled, demystified truth, sans the cryptic terminology. We will collectively build some code that illustrates the philosophy of the functional paradigm, and has a good chance of being useful in your work.\n\nWhy functional programming? \n\nThis is a paradigm from the days of Lisp and the original generation of MIT hackers. After decades of obscurity, it is moving into the mainstream because it answers two serious problems particularly well: rising code complexity, and the need to support parallelism. Any parts of it that you take away from this workshop are likely to improve your quality of life as a software engineer.\n\nFor this workshop, we will choose two programming languages to work with: one for comfort, and one for stretching. Python will be the comfort language, because of its widespread use in many fields. Haskell will be the stretch language, and no one is expected to try it if they're not comfortable. What we want is for you to get a sense of how the functional approach looks, not just in a mainstream language like Python, but also in a language built especially with the functional style in mind.",

In order to evade detection it is not uncommon for these malicious documents to execute a long chain of scripts involving macros, Javascript, and PowerShell before downloading the final payload. As a result incident responders and malware analysts need to be comfortable analyzing different document formats, and script languages to make sense of these delivery chains.\n\nIn this workshop you will work through the triage of a live malware delivery chain that includes a malicious document, malicious scripts, and a final malware payload. During this process you will be exposed to different document formats, and malscripts while you practice the skills required to manually analyze these delivery chains. This workshop focuses on the fundamental analysis techniques used when identifying, deobfuscating, and analyzing maldocs and malscripts. However, we will also provide an introduction to some free and open source tools that can be used to speed up the analysis process. \n\nThis workshop is aimed at junior incident responders, hobby malware analysts, and general security or IT practitioners who are interested in learning more about the malware triage process. If you have no experience with malware analysis but you have a good understanding of scripting languages like VBScript, and Javascript, and you are familiar with windows internals you should have no problem completing the workshop. \n\nYou will be provided with a VirtualMachine to use during the workshop, please make sure to bring a laptop that meets the following requirements. Your laptop must have VirtualBox or VMWare installed and working prior to the start of the course. Your laptop must have at least 60GB of disk space free, preferably 100GB.

However, we have found that since MacOS is the minority platform for many software packages and security platforms, it rarely gets the same attention from security vendors as Windows. This workshop will teach you to exploit that lack of attention from software like Microsoft Office and security platforms like a leading EDR solution to break in and out of a MacOS estate. The principles also apply to other *nix environments like Linux.\n\nWe will walk you through how to use open source tools, both unmodified and customized, can be used to take advantage of the difference in capability, e.g., script detection, between Windows and non-Windows platforms. We will show you how to map out an environment, how to gain code execution in multiple ways, grab credentials, find files, collect screenshots and webcam shots and exfiltrate the loot while remaining undetected.\n\nThe key takeaway is that despite the myriad of operating system security features present in MacOS and Linux, and the addition of EDR, protected MacOS or Linux environments can still be compromised by a diligent attacker using open source tooling. This workshop will show you how!\n\n[Unfortunately we cannot provide an EDR system for you to play with, so please bring your own or practice the techniques without that particular opponent.]",

Wi-Fi extends the perimeter of a supposedly-secure network to sidewalks, parking lots, and trendy coffee shops. But many hackers don't know how Wi-Fi is simultaneously both easy and difficult to attack. To understand this duality, hackers must get hands-on time attacking all kinds of networks. You really need to see both success and failure, both self-inflicted and environmental, to fully understand how to compromise Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nThis workshop isn't targeted at Faraday-level attendees. We assume that you know what a laptop and Wi-Fi is and continue from there. What you'll be doing in this workshop is:\n\n\n0. Determining your desired result of the attack\n\n1. Reconnoitering Wi-Fi networks and RF spectrum\n\n2. Identifying and prioritizing network and station targets\n\n3. Determining the best attack type for identified targets\n\n4. Hacking the bejeezus out of the target while avoiding detection\n\n\nYou'll do all of these amazing things with your laptop and Kali Linux. Kali has an exceptional set of Wi-Fi hacking tools built right in that you'll become much more familiar with during this session. You'll use a variety of tools to identify networks and connected stations, conduct broadcast denial of service attacks, capture authentication handshakes, and crack session keys.\n\n\nPip and Alex will demonstrate some techniques using different hardware like spectrum analyzers and noise generators so you can decide whether those are tools you want to add to your toolbox as well. However, none of those tools are necessary for the workshop, and many hackers never need anything beyond a laptop, Kali, a good wordlist, and practice.\n\n\nWe'll tweet any last minute workshop updates or preparation steps from @alexhammeratt.",

Specifically, the introduction of the Microsoft Antimalware Scripting Interface (AMSI) and its integration with Windows Defender has significantly raised the bar. In this hands-on class, we will learn the methodology behind obfuscating malware and avoiding detection. Students will explore the inner workings of Windows Defender and learn to employ AMSI bypass techniques and obfuscate malware using Visual Basic (VB) and Powershell. Then identify and evade sandbox environments to ensure the payloads are masked when arriving at the intended target. The final capstone will be tying all the concepts together.\n\nIn this workshop we will:\n\n1. Introduce AMSI and explain its importance\n\n2. Learn to analyze malware scripts before and after execution\n\n3. Understand how obfuscate code to avoid AMSI and Windows Defender\n\n4. Detect and avoid sandbox environments",

Due to the complexity of Kerberos delegation attacks, they are often overlooked or left unexplored. However, the introduction of Resource-based Constrained Delegation substantially widens the Kerberos attack surface, making it more important than ever for security professionals to engage with this challenge. This workshop will offer security professionals a deep dive into Kerberos delegation and demonstrate how it can be abused for privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n\nWe will open with a crash-course in Microsoft's Kerberos implementation and its delegation features, from the fundamentals of Kerberos authentication, through legacy unconstrained delegation, to classic constrained delegation. We will offer demos and hands-on labs to experiment with abusing these features.\n\nIn the second half of the workshop, we will cover resource-based constrained delegation, explain the differences between classic constrained delegation and resource-based constrained delegation, and explore novel attack primitives including:\n- Compromising hosts by modifying Active Directory computer objects\n- Bypassing restrictions on protocol transition to impersonate arbitrary users\n- Compromising a host by abusing the ticket-granting-ticket of a computer account\n- Performing local privilege escalation on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 hosts by abusing account profile pictures\n- Performing remote code execution on SQL Servers through directory listing abuse\n- Achieving hostless domain persistence\n\nParticipants will get an opportunity to try the above attacks in a lab environment.\n\nWe will also explore mitigating controls, as well as detection opportunities.",

But what about the most critical components such as PLCs?\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn how to attack PLCs, by attacking ICS protocols: a well-known legacy protocol, Modbus, as well as an open source protocol considered as the future of ICS communications, OPC-UA. And to do so, what could be better than giving you hands-on experience on real devices by hacking our model train?\n\nWe will start by defining industrial control systems and its main components, as well as explaining the key risks and vulnerabilities that affect them. We will then focus on their key assets, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and discover how they work, how they communicate, how they can be programmed to learn the methods and tools you can use to p*wn them.\n\nThen we will move on to real-world by attacking real PLCs from two major manufacturers on a dedicated setup featuring robot arms and a model train! And to conclude, probably the most difficult, let's discuss how to secure ICS communications.",

      "description": "DNS fragmentation attacks are a more recent series of attacks that take advantage of the consistent composition of fragmented DNS responses by sending a crafted (malicious) second fragment to be reassembled with a legitimate first fragment at the IP layer. Even if DNSSEC is fully implemented, an attacker can still poison unsigned \"glue\" records.\n\nThese types of attacks are difficult, and have really only been considered remotely feasible over IPv4. Most nameservers use \"per-destination\" IP-layer ID (IPID) counters, and the IPID in the IPv6 Fragment Extension Header cannot be easily guessed blindly, as the number of bits in the field has been comparatively doubled to 32 bits (making blind-guessing even in ideal conditions take an average 34 million iterations).\n\nUnfortunately, as part of optimizations made to Linux. The IPID counter is no longer truly \"per-destination\" and the IPID for a given destination can be inferred consistently enough to facilitate an attack. This allows DNS poisoning on IPv4 and IPv6 with equal consistency and precision, and makes poisoning on the first attempt \"thousands\" of times easier.\n\nThis talk will cover how this attack is carried out, how consistent it really can be, and mitigations that can be put in place by operators of both DNS nameservers and resolvers to limit its effectiveness.",

These two sets of vulnerabilities, which we named \"Magellan\" and \"Dias\" respectively, affect many devices and software. We exploited these vulnerabilities to break into some of the most popular Internet of things devices, such as Google Home with Chrome. We also exploited them on one of the most widely used Web server (Apache+PHP) and one of the most commonly used developer tool (Git).\n\nIn this presentation, we will share how we try to crack the Google Home from both hardware and software aspects, get and analyze the newest firmware, solve the problem, and introduce new methods to discover vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl through Fuzz and manual auditing. Through these methods, we found \"Magellan\", a set of three heap buffer overflow and heap data disclosure vulnerabilities in SQLite ( CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505 CVE-2018-20506 ) We also found \"Dias\", two remote memory leak and stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Curl ( CVE-2018-16890 and CVE-2019-3822 ). Considering the fact that these vulnerabilities affect many systems and software, we have issued a vulnerability alert to notify the vulnerable vendor to fix it.\n\nWe will disclose the details of \"Magellan\" and \"Dias\" for the first time and highlight some of our new vulnerability exploitation techniques. In the first part, we will introduce the results of our analysis on hardware, how to get the newest firmware from simulating an update request, and attack surface of Google Home. We will show how to use Magellan to complete the remote exploit of Google Home, we will also give a brefing talk about how to use Dias to complete the remote attack on Apache+PHP and Git.

And the quality of the current qubits is so bad that error-correction comes at a massive cost of at least 100 times the amount of qubits.\n\nWhile the world is pre-occupied whether we have universal quantum computers big enough for Shor's algorithm, Quantum Annealing is stealing the show with having factored a 20-bit number just in January this year using 97 qubits. And these qubits are actually good enough to factor bigger numbers. If we assume a linear scalability, we'd \"only\" need around 10,000 qubits to factor a 2048bit RSA key. D-Wave announced a quantum computer with 5,640 qubits, so that puts it within reach soon. \n\nSo, could Quantum Annealing be more of a threat to cryptography than Shor's algorithm on universal quantum computers? How do these algorithms work? How do they achieve a polynomial complexity to what traditional computers need exponential time? What impact will this have on the competition from NIST for the design of post-quantum-cryptography algorithms?",

I\u00edll use it to introduce the tools and methodology needed to answer these questions.  \n \nDuring this talk, attendees will get a close up look at the operations of a hardware hacker, including ARM disassembly, firmware extraction using binwalk, micro-soldering to patch an EEPROM and get a root shell over UART, and ultimately uncover an already known decade-old bug that somehow remained unnoticed in the device\u00eds firmware.  \n \nBeyond the case study I will also address alternative tactics; some did not work, others may have but were not the lowest-hanging fruit. When it comes to hardware hacking, the process is as important as the result; knowing that there are multiple ways to reach the end goal helps researchers remain confident when hurdles arise. After the talk, attendees will have an increased distrust towards always-on devices; however, they will have the background knowledge to investigate the products and systems they encounter daily.",

Meanwhile, mitigations introduced by operating systems make them harder to be exploited. More and more applications are using hybrid technologies, so we can try web security tricks to pwn them reliably with less effort.\n\nOur presentation will summarize attack surfaces and methods to find security issues in desktop applications. In particular, we will explicate some real-world cases, such as chaining multiple vulnerabilities (information leaking, CSP bypass, opened debugging port) to achieve RCE in a specialized IDE, sensitive file leaking in famous editors, privileged APIs abusing in many IM applications and so on. During our research, we find some issues actually reside in popular libraries. These flaws may affect more applications than we will demonstrate in this talk.\n\nWeb security knowledge is usually unfamiliar to desktop application developers. Attacking desktop apps using web security tricks is a non-competitive \"blue ocean\". Our presentation will focus on many design misconceptions and implementation mistakes in desktop applications. By sharing these representative lessons, we hope to help desktop application developers improve the security of their products.",

Then, the various investigative paths taken to analyze this large data set, leading to the discovery of industry actors involved in the supply chain of social media manipulation, will be presented.

All actors involved in the industry will be mapped, from malware authors, to reseller panels, and customers of fake popularity.  \n\nThe potential profitability of the industry will then be discussed, as well as the revenue division in the chain, demonstrating that the ones making the highest revenue per fake follower sold are not the malware authors, but rather those at the end of the chain.",

Moreover, keys are just pieces of metal - we will present numerous practical techniques to create restricted keys without authorisation - including new attacks on Medeco, Mul-T-Lock and Abloy key control systems.

It is a redesign of Linux's original in-kernel BPF bytecode VM used to power features like tcpdump filters. eBPF has an entirely different set of capabilities and instructions, with its primary goal being to serve as a JIT-able virtual machine instruction set that can be targeted by compilers of a memory-safe \"restricted C\" language. In the Linux kernel, it is actively being applied to anything and everything to provide performant programmatic capabilities to userland that extend traditionally kernel-based functionality.\n\nIn this exploit development focused talk, we will first introduce eBPF and discuss several nefarious techniques enabled by the technology. As we do so, we will cover the respective sets of APIs, file descriptor types, and other eBPF machinery that enable such techniques, building up from various forms of hidden IPC channels to full-fledged rootkits. Within this talk, we will walk through the implementations of the techniques we discuss so that attendees will walk away with the knowledge of how to implement their own variants. Along the way we will discuss novel container breakout techniques and interesting \"dual-purpose\" eBPF features that enable the development of mutative syscall hooks that work for processes that work for processes already attached by a debugger. Finally, we will provide insight on how defenders should begin to attempt to detect and recover from such abuses, when possible at all.\n\nThis presentation significantly extends on work we first presented at 35C3, which focused more heavily on the underlying aspects of general eBPF-based kernel tracing.

Election security, blockchain, \"going dark,\" the vulnerabilities equities debate, IoT safety , data privacy, algorithmic security and fairness, critical infrastructure: these are all important public policy issues with a strong Internet security component. But while an understanding of the technology involved is fundamental to crafting good policy, there is little involvement of technologists in policy discussions. This is not sustainable. We need public-interest technologists: people from our fields helping craft policy, and working to provide security to agencies and groups working in the broader public interest. We need these people in government, at NGOs, teaching at universities, as part of the press, and inside private companies. This is increasingly critical to both public safety and overall social welfare. This talk both describes the current state of public-interest technology, and offers a way forward for us individually and collectively for our field. The defining policy question of the Internet age is this: How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms? We need to be involved in that debate.SSL VPNs protect corporate assets from Internet exposure, but what if SSL VPNs themselves are vulnerable? They\u00edre exposed to the Internet, trusted to reliably guard the only way to intranet. However, we found pre-auth RCEs on multiple leading SSL VPNs, used by nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies and many government organizations. To make things worse, a \u00ecmagic\u00ee backdoor was found to allow changing any user\u00eds password with no credentials required! To show how bad things can go, we will demonstrate gaining root shell from the only exposed HTTPS port, covertly weaponizing the server against their owner, and abusing a hidden feature to take over all VPN clients!\n\nIn such complicated closed-source systems, gaining root shell from outside the box certainly ain\u00edt easy. It takes advanced web and binary exploitation techniques to struggle for a way to root shell, which involves abusing defects in web architectures, hard-core Apache jemalloc exploitation and more. We will cover every detail of all the dirty tricks, crazy bug chains, and the built-in backdoor. After gaining root shell into the box, we then elaborate on post exploitation and how we hack back the clients. In addition, we will share the attack vectors against SSL VPNs to kick start researches on similar targets. On the other hand, from our previous experience, we derive general hardening actions that mitigate not only all the above attacks, but any other potential 0days.\n\nIn summary, we disclose practical attacks capable of compromising millions of targets, including tech giants and many industry leaders. These techniques and methodologies are published in the hope that it can inspire more security researchers to think out-of-the-box; enterprises can apply immediate mitigation, and realize that SSL VPN is not merely Virtual Private Network, but also a \u00ecVulnerable Point of your Network\u00ee.",

      "description": "The 2016 WWDC saw the dawn of Apple Pay Web, an API that lets websites embed an Apple Pay button within their web-facing stores.  Supporting it required a complex request flow, complete with client certificates and a custom session server. This proved detrimental, since Apple failed to caution against important side effects of taking in untrusted URLs.  As a result, many new SSRF vulnerabilities entered the world. Worse yet, while they were exploitable and discoverable in similar ways, they were spread across distinct codebases in several programming languages, so could not be patched in any generic way.\n\nApple is not alone - in the process of gluing the web together, Twilio, Salesforce, and others have all created similarly broad attack surfaces.  When companies fail to take an honest, empathetic look at how clients will use a product, they shove along hidden security burdens. Those who integrate with an API have less context than those who create it, so are in a worse position to recognize these risks.\n\nEngineers have been talking about defensive programming for decades, but top companies still have trouble practicing it.  In this talk we explore these mistakes with demos of affected software, and introduce a powerful model for finding broad classes of bugs.",

      "description": "Pointer Authentication (in short, PAuth) is the latest security mechanism in iOS. It is proposed to protect the integrity of pointers with hardware-assisted encryption, thus eliminating the threats of code-reuse attacks. In PAuth, a cryptographic signature called PAC is calculated from a pointer value and inserted into the pointer. When the pointer is about to be used, the PAC is extracted and verified whether it is consistent with the original pointer value. In this way, PAuth is able to ensure that the pointers are not tampered. iOS deployed PAuth in user-space system services, protecting pointers that may affect the control flow and preventing code-reuse attacks like ROP and JOP.\n\n    However, in our study, we found that a fatal flaw in the implementation of iOS PAuth makes user-space system services till vulnerable to code-reuse attacks. The flaw is: iOS uses the same signing key in different user-space processes. This flaw allows a signed pointer from a malicious process can be correctly verified in a system service, thus making it possible to launch JOP. In this talk, we will explain how we found the flaw and why it is inevitable. In advance, we will demonstrate how to leverage this flaw and launch JOP attacks in a PAuth-protected system service. Also, we will propose a new tool, PAC-gadget, to automatically find JOP gadgets in PAuth-protected binaries.",

If malicious actors could manipulate access control systems, boiler rooms, or temperature control for critical industrial systems, the potential for catastrophic damage is extreme.\n\nMcAfee's ATR team has discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a major building controller.  This controller is a fully programmable native BACnet\u00f4 device designed to manage a wide range of building systems.  By modifying BACnet broadcast traffic, a buffer overflow can be leveraged into a write-what-where (WWW) condition. This WWW leads to execution control, providing the attacker with a root shell and complete control over the device remotely.  Because this attack vector is through BACnet broadcast traffic, there is no authentication mechanism for the target device, allowing anyone on the same network to communicate with it directly and exploit the vulnerability without authentication. Currently, there are over 500 of these devices connected to the internet running in BACnet/IP Broadcast Management Device (BBMD) mode.  Utilizing this mode, broadcast traffic can travel over the internet, increasing the potentially devastating impact of this vulnerability.\n\nThis presentation will include a deep technical analysis of the vulnerability discovery process and demos illustrating an attack in a critical scenario.  Finally, we will discuss the steps taken by the vendor to patch this vulnerability and demonstrate its effectiveness.",

It's often said that recovering an AES key should take longer than the remainder of the life of the sun. However, this assumes that keys are chosen properly, and that there is no way to determine whether a key is the correct one after a candidate key is used to decrypt a captured ciphertext.  In practice, these conditions do not always hold. In much the same way that hash functions are impossible to reverse but hash cracking is still a practical attack, in the real world it is often possible to perform practical key search attacks. In this talk, we will discuss the common mistakes and common conditions that allow for practical brute force recovery of keys for modern block ciphers such as AES.

Finally, we present two 0-day vulnerabilities within Cisco IOS and TAm and demonstrate a remotely exploitable attack chain that results in persistent compromise of an up-to-date Cisco router. We discuss the implementation of our TAm bypass, which involves novel methods of reliably manipulating FPGA functionality through bitstream analysis and modification while circumventing the need to perform RTL reconstruction.

      "description": "Return-oriented Programming (ROP) has been the predominate code-reuse attack for over a decade, but there are other options. Many mitigations can detect ROP due to heuristics, but these fail to detect Jump-oriented Programming (JOP). The JOP ROCKET is a reverse engineering framework dedicated to facilitating JOP exploits. It allows hackers to discover JOP gadgets. This includes dispatcher gadget's, which helps to subvert and direct the control flow, and functional gadgets, our primitives. This tool provides numerous options to give hackers flexibility on how to find gadgets, to narrow and expand possibilities. Additionally, the tool uses opcode-splitting to discover many unintended gadgets. All gadgets are classified based on operation as well as registers used and affected. Thus, hackers could easily obtain the desired functional gadgets, such as MOV EBX, [VALUE], using simple language commands. Because of JOP's much more complex set up, the tool provides this classification, so time isn\u00edt wasted hunting through results.\n\nJOP is rarely done in the wild. Part of that complexity is in set up, but another part is the lack of dedicated tools. Having to find JOP gadgets manually could be time-consuming and require expertise. JOP ROCKET simplifies that, allowing the JOP gadgets to be found quickly and easily.\n\nThis talk will give brief content on ROP, and then it introduces JOP and its history. Then we will dive into JOP ROCKET, discussing its features, how to use it to find JOP gadgets, and how to set up your own JOP exploit. We will then demo the tool.",

Instead of targeting the underlying cryptographic primitives, our attacks abuse legitimate features of the MIME standard and HTML, as supported by email clients, to deceive the user regarding the actual message content. We demonstrate how the attacker can unknowingly abuse the user as a decryption oracle by replying to an unsuspicious looking email. Using this technique, the plaintext of hundreds of encrypted emails can be leaked at once. Furthermore, we show how users could be tricked into signing arbitrary text by replying to emails containing CSS conditional rules. An evaluation shows that 17 out of 19 OpenPGP-capable email clients, as well as 21 out of 22 clients supporting S/MIME, are vulnerable to at least one attack.

      "description": "Bluetooth Low energy version 5 has been published in late 2016, but we still have no sniffer supporting this specific version (and not that much compatible devices as well). The problem is this new version introduces a new channel hopping algorithm that renders previous sniffing tools useless as devices can no longer be attacked and connections analyzed. This new algorithm is based on a brand new pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to provide better collision avoidance while kicking out all of our good old sniffing tools.\n\nUnless some random hacker manages to break this not-that-strong PRNG and upgrades his BLE sniffing tool to support this algorithm ;). In this talk, we will explain why this PRNG is vulnerable and how it can be easily defeated to sniff and jam communications between two BLE 5 devices. A new version of BtleJack will be released during this talk, providing an efficient way to sniff BLE 5 connections to our fellow IoT hacker family.",

      "description": "The security of common enterprise infrastructure devices such as desktops and laptops has advanced over the years through incremental improvements in operating system and endpoint security. However, security controls for network devices such as enterprise printers are often ignored and thus present a greater potential for exploitation and compromise by threat actors seeking to gain a persistent foothold on target organisations.\n\nIn order to assess the current state of mainstream enterprise printer product security and to challenge common assumptions made about the security of these devices, which sit on key parts of enterprise networks and process sensitive data, we set out on a vulnerability and exploitation research project of six known vendors. We were able to find remote vulnerabilities in all printers tested through various attack vectors, revealing a large number of 0-day vulnerabilities in the process.\n\nIn this talk we walk through the entire research engagement, from initial phases such as threat modelling to understand printer attack surfaces to the development of attack methodologies and fuzzing tools used to target printer-specific protocols and functions. Besides of remarking important vulnerabilities found and their respective CVE\u00eds, proof of concept exploits showing how it is possible to gain full control of printers and all of the data they manage will be presented. This will show how to use enterprise printers as a method of persistence on a network, perhaps to exfiltrate sensitive data or support C2 persistence on Red Team engagements.\n\nWe also address a number of challenges that researchers can face when performing vulnerability research on devices such as printers and how we used different techniques to overcome these challenges, working with limited to no debugging and triage capabilities. We also present mitigations that printer manufacturers can implement in order to reduce printer attack surfaces and render exploitation more difficult.",

Applicable only at the local computer level, a user generally has different rights (through access tokens) on different machines in a domain. Another part of the access control model is security descriptors (ACLs) that protects a securable object. At the domain level, ACL abuse is well known and adversaries have used it for persistence. For user rights, the abuse is mostly with the help of groups (memberships, SID History etc.) or misconfigured delegated rights. \n\nA lesser-known area of abuse and offensive research is a combination of minimal Rights and ACE (hence the term RACE). Often overlooked in audits and assessments, using minimal rights along with favourable ACEs provides a very interesting technique of persistence and on-demand privilege escalation on a Windows machine with much desired stealth.\nThis talk covers interesting domain privilege escalation, persistence and backdoor techniques with the help of ACLs, minimal user rights and combinations of both. We will discuss how these techniques can be applied using open source tools and scripts. The talk also covers how to detect and mitigate such attacks. \n\nThe talk will be full of live demonstrations.",

      "description": "The presentation demonstrates that the security of the A5/1 and A5/3 ciphers used to protect cellular calls are vulnerable to compromise leading to full decryption of GSM communications, using freely available open source solutions along with our tools we developed for this task.\n\nThe flaw being exploited lies in the heart of the design of GSM. In all implementations the standard requires GSM messages to first be error control encoded using a convolutional code and then encrypted. In the vast majority of implementations used today, encryption is performed using the A5/1 or A5/3 cipher. The convolutional code adds redundancy to the transmitted message, which can act like a fingerprint to identify the key used to encrypt the GSM message.\n\nTo exploit the vulnerability an attacker simply needs to capture a transmission and identify the GSM channel used. The standard defines the convolutional code and therefore how the redundancy may be interpreted to recover the encryption key.\n\nThis presentation considers passively capturing GSM traffic using A5/3 encryption and demonstrates a novel solution to cracking the key used without interacting with the mobile or network.",

However, while things seem to be running smoothly, new bugs are brewing at the core of major implementation libraries. This is probably the last chance for the evil empire to launch a world scale attack against the Auth Federation. \n\nIn this talk, we will present two new techniques: \n    1) A new breed of SAML implementation flaws that break XML signature validation and enable arbitrary modification of the SAML assertion, which enables attackers to authenticate as arbitrary users or grant themselves arbitrary authorization claims. Although any implementation may be affected by this flaw, we will show how it affects Microsoft Windows Identity Framework (WIF) applications, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) web services, and flagship products such as SharePoint and Exchange Servers. \n    2) A bug in the .NET crypto library, which may allow attackers to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the availability of code gadgets in the target server. \n\nA new tool to detect this type of vulnerability will also be discussed and released.",

Last year, hundreds of security papers and talks on fuzzing have been published and dozens of them were focused on adapting or improving American Fuzzy Lop in some way. Attracting with its simplicity and efficiency, AFL is the number one choice for the vast majority of security researchers. This high popularity means that hunting for bugs with AFL or a similar tool is becoming less and less fruitful since many projects are already covered by other researchers. It is especially hard when we talk about a project participating in Google OSS-Fuzz program which utilizes AFL to generate a half-trillion test cases per day.\n\nIn practice, this means that we can not blindly rely on AFL anymore and should search for better fuzzing techniques. In order to overcome this challenge, we need to understand how AFL and similar fuzzers work and be able to use their weaknesses to find new 0days. This talk is aimed to discuss these weaknesses on real examples, explain how we can do fuzzing better and release a new open-source fuzzer called Manul.\n\nManul is a high-scalable coverage-guided parallel fuzzer with the ability to search for bugs in open source and black box binaries on Windows and Linux. Manul was able to find 10 0-days in 4 widely-used projects that have been extensively tested by AFL. These vulnerabilities were not found by chance, but by analyzing and addressing issues exist in AFL.

Connected vacuum robots are not as low-budget as other IoT devices and vendors indeed invest into their security. This makes vacuum cleaning robot ecosystems interesting for further analysis to understand their security mechanisms and derive takeaways.\n\nIn this talk we discuss the security of the well-protected Neato and Vorwerk ecosystems. Their robots run the proprietary QNX operating system, are locally protected with secure boot, and use various mechanisms that ensure authentication and encryption in the cloud communication. Nonetheless, we were able to bypass substantial security components and even gain unauthenticated privileged remote execution on arbitrary robots. We present how we dissected ecosystem components including a selection of vacuum robot firmwares and their cloud interactions.",

Nowadays, they are responsible for controlling a wide range of interesting systems, e.g., physical security systems, car\u00eds ECUs, semaphores, elevators, sensors, critical components of industrial systems, some home appliances and even robots.\n\nIn this talk, it will be explained how microcontrollers can be backdoored too. After a quick review of basic knowledge about uC, we will dive into three different approaches to achieve payload injection, from basic to advanced techniques. The first method consists on locating the entry point of the firmware and inject our payload there, this is an easy way to execute it at least once. As a second -and more complex- technique, we will backdoor the EUSART communication injecting a malicious payload at the code routine of that hardware peripheral; we will be able to get the right memory address by inspecting the GIE, PEIE and polling process at the uC interrupt vector. Finally, the third technique allow us to take control of the microcontroller\u00eds program flow by manipulating the stack writing memory addresses at the TOS; with this we can execute a payload made with instructions already written in the original program, performing it just like a ROP-chain technique.",

Many serious vulnerabilities are found on most of them and reported to vendors. Algorithm and design flaws in these apps can lead to file leaking and tampering, privacy leaks, arbitrary file downloads and even remote code execution. We will present all the related vulnerabilities' details and exploit techniques. Next, we conducted the same research on lots of third-party file sharing apps and found that they are even worse about security and are used by surprising more than 1 billion users. Files transferred between them are nearly naked when our MITM attack devices are nearby. Finally, we will summarize all the attack vectors and two common attack models. We will also present the attack demos and related tools.\n\nBesides, we will present our practical mitigations.

Without the debugger, it's difficult to inspect the program flow and runtime status. On Qualcomm platform, subsystems are protected by the Secure Boot and unable to be touched externally. We'll introduce the vulnerability we found in Modem to defeat the Secure Boot and elevate privilege into Modem locally so that we can setup the live debugger for baseband.\n\nThe Modem and WLAN firmware is quite complex and reverse engineering is a tough work. Thanks to the debugger, we finally figure out the system architecture, the components, the program flow, the data flow, and the attack surfaces of WLAN firmware. We'll share these techniques in detail, along with the zero-days we found on the attack surfaces.\n\nThere are multiple mitigations on Qualcomm baseband, including DEP, stack protection, heap cookie, system call constraint, etc. All the details of the exploitation and mitigation bypassing techniques will be given during the presentation.\n\nStarting from Snapdragon 835, WLAN firmware is integrated into the Modem subsystem as an isolated userspace process. We'll discuss these constraints, and then leverage the weakness we found to fully exploit into Modem.",

But when you get back to your hotel the real shock hits you: someone infected your camera with ransomware! All your images are encrypted, and the camera is locked. How could that happen?In this talk, we show a live demo of this exact scenario. Join us as we take a deep dive into the world of the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP). The same protocol that allows you to control your camera from your phone or computer, can also enable any attacker to do that and more. We will describe in detail how we found multiple vulnerabilities in the protocol and how we exploited them remotely(!) to take over this embedded device.But it doesn't end here. While digging into our camera, we found a reliable way to take over most of the DSLR cameras without exploiting any vulnerability at all. We simply had to ask our camera to do that for us, and it worked.\n\nThis is the first vulnerability research on the Picture Transfer Protocol, a vendor agnostic logical layer that is common to all modern-day cameras. As DSLR cameras are used by consumers and journalists alike, this opens up the door for future research on these sensitive embedded devices.",

Now your configuration mistakes can be accessed by anyone on the internet, without that fancy next-gen firewall saving you. With this talk I\u00edll share my current research on Azure privileges, vulnerabilities and what attackers can do once they gain access to your cloud, or how they can abuse your on-premise cloud components. We start with becoming Domain Admin by compromising Azure AD Sync, sync vulnerabilities that allow for Azure admin account takeover and insecure Single Sign On configurations. Up next is cloud roles and privileges, backdooring Azure AD with service accounts, escalating privileges as limited admin and getting past MFA without touching someone's phone. Then we finish with cloud integrations, also known as \"how a developer can destroy your whole infrastructure with a single commit\": Exploring Azure DevOps, backdooring build pipelines, dumping credentials and compromising Azure Resource Manager through connected services. Besides all the fun we'll also look into how this translates into the questions you should ask yourself before moving things to the cloud and how this differs from on-premise.",

      "description": "During a classic cyber attack, one of the major offensive goals is to execute code remotely on valuable machines. The purpose of that code varies on the spectrum from information extraction to physical damage. As defenders, our goal is to detect and eliminate any malicious code activity, while hackers continuously find ways to bypass the most advanced detection mechanisms. It\u00eds an endless cat-and-mouse game where new mitigations and features are continuously added to the endpoint protection solutions and even the OS itself in order to protect the users against newly discovered attack techniques.   In this talk, we present a new approach for malicious code to bypass most of endpoint protection measures. Our approach covertly proxies the malicious code operations over the network, never deploying the actual malicious code on the victim side. We are going to execute code on an endpoint, without really storing the code on disk or loading it to memory. This technique potentially allows attackers to run malicious code on remote victims, in such a way that the code is undetected by the victim\u00eds security solutions.  We denote this technique as \u00ecmalproxying\u00ee.",

In doing so, we tested their viability as localised acoustic weapons which could cause temporary/permanent hearing damage and/or adverse psychological effects. We examined a number of countermeasures, including a tool to detect specified frequencies above specified thresholds. \n\nIn this talk, I will cover the background of malware which has, intentionally or not, caused physical or psychological harm. I will explore previous research on the harmful effects of sound, focusing particularly on high and low frequencies, and some of the guidance which has been proposed to limit exposure to such sound. I will examine the use of imperceptible sound as applied to security research (covert channels, ultrasonic tracking beacons, etc), and will present our experiments and findings, including threat models, methodology, the attacks we developed, and the implications of our results.

Even high-security devices like hardware cryptocurrency wallets use such an architecture. Unfortunately, this arrangement has a history of security bugs due to misconfigured protection hardware, bugs in kernel code, hardware bugs, and side channels.\n\nThis talk proposes a new approach to isolation for devices like crypto wallets: separate the user and kernel onto two CPUs and multiplex processes by completely resetting the user processor between tasks so that there is no leakage.\n\nProcessor reset is more complicated than might be expected. Simply asserting the reset line isn't enough to clear all CPU-internal state, but it turns out that software can be used to clear this state. However, reasoning about the correctness of such code is challenging. This talk presents a tool that can be used to develop and formally verify the correctness of reset code for a given CPU implementation.\n\nThis talk also walks through a design of a wallet based on this reset-based isolation technique, discusses known security vulnerabilities in current designs such as the Ledger and Trezor wallets (including bugs in MPU misconfiguration, system calls, and drivers), and explores how a reset-based design could prevent such vulnerabilities.",
