      "title": "Every Breath You Take: A CTI Review of Stalkerware",
      "description": "A common misconception is that Cyber Threat Intelligence is just for Corporate America or governments. Let’s challenge that assumption with a practical application of CTI to the issue of stalkerware. Security professionals might consider stalkerware a tool for overly-controlling partners or parents, but what if I told you there’s more? Stalkerware presents a hostile actor with a (questionably) legal, commoditized, and easily consumable “software” that has many of the same features of backdoors and other malware we all fight to keep out of our environments, and what wrongdoer wouldn’t take advantage of that? In fact, stalkerware has already been linked to nation-state governments spying on dissidents and journalists. In this talk, you’ll get additional insights into stalkerware; what it is, how it works, who it targets, CTI hypotheses and suggested RFIs to other teams, and of course, no CTI review would be complete without a discussion of the various hostile actors that leverage stalkerware and their tradecraft. Takeaways include glimpses into the dark side of humanity and a report for your threat intelligence platform, as well as ideas of how security professionals can start to tackle this problem as a part of their CTI program.",

      "description": "Many times Critical Infrastructure is brought up in news articles and other events without providing a clear understanding on how this is managed within the US.  Additionally the US Government, DHS, DOE, and many others have presented on the Cybersecurity weaknesses within critical infrastructure based on individual sectors, but have never presented on the collected Cybersecurity weaknesses or how the failures in one sector would impact the next.  This presentation will provide a simple overview of how the government manages US Critical infrastructure and some issues that presents.  It will discuss how a simple natural gas or water outage could trickle down through the rest of critical infrastructure over the course of several weeks. The presentation also covers how responding to a ICS related cybersecurity is different to a typical IT cybersecurity incident, and what attendees could do to ensure they are ready and the companies they defend are prepared.  This presentation is beneficial to all cyber teams, physical security, management and other members of a company.",

      "title": "[In]secure deserialization, and how [not] to do it",
      "description": "Serialized data is neither new nor exciting. Serialization and deserialization have been in use by countless applications, services and frameworks for a long time. Many programming languages support serialization natively, and most people seem to understand it well. However, many of us don’t fully understand security implications of data deserialization, and in the last couple of years this topic got an increasing focus in the security community, up to the point that insecure deserialization made it to the list of OWASP Top 10 most critical web application security risks! Needless to say high-severity vulnerabilities in some well-known applications as well as popular frameworks such as Apache Struts and Apache Commons Collections raised awareness of this risk.\n\nIn this session, we’ll discuss how serialized data are used in software, talk about different serialization formats and the dangers of deserializing untrusted input. We will review some real life vulnerabilities and related exploits. The presentation will contain several code examples with live demos of bypassing security controls by exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities. We’ll forge a session cookie, elevate privileges, cause a denial of service, and even perform a remote code execution - all via insecure deserialization! The demos will use native Java, Python and .NET serialization, as well as JSON and XML formats. Of course, we’ll also talk about how to deserialize in secure way!\n\nNext time you develop your awesome web or mobile app or a microservice, keep in mind how a clever attacker could create and supply malicious data to your application, and thinking like a hacker you could write more secure code!",

Protecting one’s self can feel impossible, however it is not! \n \nAre words on the internet/emails/private messages considered harassment, seen as threatening, or just freedom of speech?\n \nI will share the first-hand extensive knowledge on options. Life tossed me a curveball, which resulted in a life experience which lets me share how to help individuals through a series of options to be protected and for additional help. \n \nDo not feel helpless, evidence can be gathered. Protective orders can be obtained. Individuals who have been harassed causing mental trauma have the right to file for FMLA (NOT just for babies folks!).  This allows them to take the necessary time off work without having a fear of losing employment.\n \nThe options provided will include tips on how to document and obtain evidence, tips for interviewing lawyers to find an attorney that meets specialized standards for cyber, and how to reach out to get help that can protect an individual in their career.\n \nI truly wish I knew during my experiences these options and by sharing my experiences, as long as one person is helped, then it makes my adventure worth it.",

      "description": "Threats surround us like a ring of burning fire. Unfortunately, incident response doesn't come naturally to an operational mindset where the focus tends to be on reactive problem solving. As a volunteer firefighter for over twenty years, the presenter has learned a lot about what is and isn't effective. There are surprising parallels between fighting real-life fires and the fire-fighting that passes for today’s incident response. For example, striking a balance between swift response and patient reflection is often the the difference between life and death, in a very literal sense for the firefighter and a figurative sense for the security professional. It’s also all too easy to get tunnel vision and focus on the wrong areas, costing precious time. The security world is full of dumpster fires these days, so join this session to learn from a good firefighter what makes a good security person.",

      "description": "One thing that you learn in the technology space is that change is constant. Companies, solutions, and people who sit on their laurels can find themselves in a position of never-ending catch up. For security operations and application security professionals who rely exclusively on web application firewalls (WAFs) or runtime application security protection (RASP), this talk should open your eyes to better understanding gaps. Tethered to traditional signature-based security approaches, WAFs simply aren't able to keep pace with the changes in the advanced threat landscape. But at the same time, RASP does not provide some of the same bot and DDoS protections that a WAF may provide. And yet, application security professionals are still directly comparing a WAF and RASP as to use one or the other, which is like comparing virus protection and endpoint detection and response (EDR). In this talk we explain the similarities and differences between a WAF and RASP. We will discuss things such as vulnerability deferment, bot detections, antiquated application protections, IP blocking, alert fatigue, etc. We will also dig in to how WAF and RASP should work harmoniously and why you should be utilizing the strengths and benefits of each in your overall application security protection scheme.",

      "description": "After reviewing over 10 billion botnets records, a lot of unusual records come to mind. Unlike much of stolen data, botnets do a great job in record keeping. Who, when, where, what and even sometimes how and why questions get answered. Let's try connecting credentials stolen by a botnet and an unattributed breach and we may be able to tell who was breached, and even when. When web or network admin gets infected by a virus, what happens to their website/network? What data do botnet administrators sell, what do they discard, what do they keep for themselves? What are the attack and distribution patterns based on botnet's first records? This presentation which is based on research and practical examples will lift a veil off the botnets and will make mining data significantly more actionable.",

      "description": "The end is near. The network lies in ruins. Security tools are now forbidden on the network. Could this disaster have been avoided? If you can’t properly perform root cause analysis (RCA) as a security practitioner, then this event is likely in your future. Through proper application of RCA methods, you can not only avoid networking teams using the nuclear option on you, but actually be the hero by helping solve their problems too! These techniques will also ensure that you are not playing whack-a-mole by only solving surface problems and instead eradicate entire classes of issues.\nThis presentation will cover the basics of RCA processes including the “5 Whys” and Ishakawa diagrams and using them to solve real-life computing problems, some of which almost caused the cessation of all security activities. Things are going to break and everyone needs to know how to fix them. Attendees can expect to learn how to examine problems that occur thoroughly to ensure they are fixing systemic issues to effect significant improvements in their businesses. This presentation is accessible to attendees of all skill and experience levels. An understanding of basic security technologies and terminologies will be useful for a complete understanding of all the vignettes.",

      "description": "Cryptography is tricky. Sure, everybody knows not to roll out their own crypto, but is it enough? Are the standard algorithms, libraries, and utilities always used the right way? This is of course a rhetorical question! Humans keep making mistakes that other humans can exploit, and Murphy’s law continues to prove true: “If there is a wrong way to do something, then someone will do it.”\n\nIn this talk, not only will we discuss what can go wrong, but also how attackers could take advantage of that. Insufficient entropy? Static initialization vector? Key reuse in stream cipher? Lack of ciphertext integrity? We’ve heard these terms and may be familiar with them in theory, but let’s see actual examples of these and other crypto mistakes and corresponding exploits, and understand how they could lead to real life problems.\n\nAre you not on a red team and not interested in exploitation? Then this talk is for you too! Come and learn how to avoid common crypto mistakes in your code!",

This is when we can we become obsessed with the ‘latest and greatest’, the ‘next-next gen’, the ‘flashy dashboard’ and we fall into the trap of ignoring ‘the basics’. The pyramids from ancient Egypt stand tall today in large part to being built on a solid foundation. How can we, as an IT Security team protect assets that we know nothing about? If we are not vigilant and put controls in place to secure a solid foundation the waves of time will erode our environment.

As an IT professional, the ability to quickly and efficiently identify, contain, remediate, and investigate cloud incidents when they arise, may seem like an exceedingly daunting task without the proper knowledge and tools. This talk will focus on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and the methods that can be leveraged to effectively conduct digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tasks. While GCP offers a user friendly API and SDK, there are multiple steps involved in containing a host, collecting a disk image, and conducting other needed DFIR tasks. \n\nIn addition to exploring the GCP-native commands that can be leveraged for forensics and incident response, a new cloud automation tool will be released that can be leveraged to speed up identification, containment, response, and analysis in GCP. This innovative DFIR assistant is CAFIR (Cloud Automated Forensics & Incident Response). CAFIR is a one stop shop to streamline, simplify, and speed up incident response and forensics tasks in GCP as well as providing the ability for IT security professionals to conduct investigations in GCP without the need to research and understand GCP specific tools and commands.",

From the simple \"Photoshop\" to the modern equivalent in video, fakes are becoming more and more difficult to spot. This makes them a great candidate for abuse.\n\nFor years we have been telling people that what they post on the internet will be there to stay and can have huge ramifications later in life, but what if they don't actually do what is portrayed?\n\nModern technology can use Machine Learning and AI to dissect videos, extract faces and build virtual models that are used to automatically replace the faces, all while retaining eye blinks and facial expressions. \n\nFor millions of people, realistic fakes can ruin a career, destroy families and possibly even influence elections. Even if proven fake later, the damage can be irreversible and in this digital age, can last a lifetime. \n\nThis session will look at the technology behind creating these fakes, potential attacks using the technology and what is being done to combat this trend and protect us from what even appears to be ourselves.",

      "description": "Did you know that an average of 14,600 vulnerabilities are disclosed each year? How are you handling your discovered vulnerabilities? Vulnerability management is a difficult task, especially at a large organization. In fact, it takes an average of 100 days until known security vulnerabilities are remediated. Often times vulnerability management is implemented in segments, without a big picture vision. It can be also arduous and cumbersome, costing employees valuable time and effort. However, vulnerability management is a necessity in today's cyber security landscape.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss where vulnerability management programs fall short and how we can avoid such pitfalls. We will walk through a typical program and the pain points. Once we understand the problem, we will enhance the process through automating asset inventory and daily vulnerability collection. We will also demonstrate how using automation to search asset inventory for newly discovered vulnerabilities increases speed and efficiency of the team and helps to more quickly create action items from discovered vulnerabilities. In addition, our process will help teams determine which vulnerabilities are the riskiest and organize them by remediation priority.\n\nThe vulnerability management program is built from the ground up across a complex work environment using Python3, Jenkins, SQL, and a few extra tips and tricks. Proof-of-concept code will be open sourced at the conclusion of the discussion and attendees will leave this talk with the ability to implement similar automated vulnerability management solutions in their environments.",

This results in vulnerabilities and eventually breaches of those environments. This session will take lessons from good BBQ techniques and apply them to our security architecture. We'll examine five rules all good pitmasters swear by and see how those same concepts can form a framework of security defense design that eliminates common pitfalls.

How would we transmits data?\n\nThat's right, Radio waves. Data over the air, traveling at C. Yes, C. C is FAST! And with it we can send information super-duper fast.\n\nIn this \"course\" we'll \"learn\" about how wireless data signals can be reverse engineered.\n\nI've never taught this course before so a lot is to be developed. Also I need an audience.",

A large amount of information has been published, but in many cases the documentation is high level and not easily applied tactically in day-to-day activities.\n \nDuring this training we will look at common sources of Threat Intelligence and determine what can be useful for sharing internally at your organization.  Taking the information further, we will see how to make use of Threat Intelligence to aid in risk identification and Hunting.\n \nHands-on lab work and discussion will allow attendees to practice related skills.",

Racing against other teams, solving brain-twisting challenges and seeing new ways to compromise systems teaches and entertains.\nCTFs are also a great tool to give non-security folks a hands on understanding of how security vulnerabilities enable criminal activities, reduce user privacy and degrade system reliability. \nIn this session you will learn to build interesting, educational and easy to use Capture the Flag events targeted at developers and other technical, non-security, users.\nWe will cover specific considerations for each audience you target, how to create interesting (yet solvable) challenges, and how to make the overall experience friction free for the participants.\nYou will also learn tools and techniques to create easily repeatable, consistent events with minimal work. We will cover collaborative development, external system integration techniques, tooling and a fully automated deployment pipeline to make spinning up a new CTF as easy as pushing a button.",
