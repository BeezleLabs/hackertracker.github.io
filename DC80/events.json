They have allowed for test case generation at a rate impossible by hand and the creation of test cases humans may never conceive of. While there are many excellent fuzzers available most are designed for mutating source files or input in random ways and attempting to discover edge cases in the handling of them. Some others are designed with structured input in mind and use grammars to more strategically generate and mutate possible inputs that adhere to the format defined. These specifically are the ones we care about for the goals of identifying differences between multiple implementations of a single language, finding bugs in parse tree generation/handling of tokens, and handling of the data at runtime once it has been successfully lexically and syntactically analyzed.

When secure connections in the enterprise are inspected, reliance only on transmission level security may not be enough to accomplish that goal. Foxtrot C2 serves one goal: safe last mile delivery of payloads and commands between the external network and the internal point of presence, traversing intercepting proxies, with the end-to-end application level encryption. While the idea of end-to-end application encryption is certainly not new, the exact mechanism of Foxtrot's delivery implementation has advantages to Red Teams as it relies on a well known third party site, enjoying elevated ranking and above average domain fronting features. Payload delivery involves several OpSec defenses: sensible protection from direct attribution, active link expiration to evade consistent interception, inspection, tracking and replay activities by the defenders. Asymmetric communication channels will also be used. And if your standalone Foxtrot agent is caught, the delivery mechanism may live on, you could still manually bring the agent back into the environment via the browser. A concept tool built on these ideas will be presented and released. It will be used as basis for our discussion.",

They bought boxes that blink and software that floods the SOC with alerts. Is it enough? The overwhelming answer is: No. The security controls that matter most are the ones that best protect those with the keys to the enterprise, the Active Directory administrators. With this access, an attacker can do anything they want in the environment: access all sensitive data, change access controls and security settings, embed to persist (for years), and often fully manage and control routers, switches, the virtualization platform (VMWare or Microsoft Hyper-V), and increasingly, the cloud platform. Administrators are being dragged into a new paradigm where they have to more securely administer the environment. This involves protecting privileged credentials and limiting access Again the question is: Are the new ways to securely administer Active Directory enough to protect against attackers? Join me in this session to find out. Some of the areas explored in this talk: * Explore how common methods of administration fail. * Demonstrating how attackers can exploit flaws in typical Active Directory administration. * Highlight common mistakes organizations make when administering Active Directory. * Discuss what's required to protect admins from modern attacks. * Provide the best methods to ensure secure administration and how to get executive, operations, and security team acceptance.",

Developers, security teams, and executives alike favor the ease of use and full administrative control Macs provide. However, their systems are often joined to an active directory domain and ripe for attackers to leverage for initial access and lateral movement. Mac malware is evolving as Mac computers continue to grow in popularity. As a result, there is a need for proactive detection of attacks targeting MacOS systems in a enterprise environment. Despite advancements in MacOS security tooling for a single user/endpoint, little is known and discussed regarding detection at a enterprise level. This talk will discuss common tactics, techniques and procedures used by attackers on MacOS systems, as well as methods to detect adversary activity. We will take a look at known malware, mapping the techniques utilized to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Attendees will leave equipped to begin hunting for evil lurking within their MacOS fleet.",

It will be dope as it allows us to dig into topics such as: Is security a fad? How do we differentiate a fad from something here to stay? Encouraging youth to become security engineers, a call-to-action for the community. Deviating from established norms and setting trends, few truly change the industry, and who will change the security industry in the near future?

It looks at the benefits of adopting IoT for medical devices, current exposure, common communication channels in use as well as interconnectivity approaches used with other critical components. Based off output from security assessments performed against medical devices widely deployed at various hospitals and medical institutions, we will present an in-depth analysis of the target medical device and elaborate on how we were able to compromise them to gain access to plethora of medical records from all the medical institutions they were deployed at and not just the one where our target devices were hosted.We will introduce the threat surface exposed by various medical devices and present some of the real-world attacks against some popular devices & their impact on humans as well as the overall ecosystem they are connected to. Some devices rely on proprietary hardware on licensed bands, which reduces the risk of interference from consumer connected devices, but doesn\u2019t provide security as implied in marketing materials. Others rely on standard WiFi security measures for confidentiality and are prone to MitM attacks. Healthcare devices that implement IrDA could yield interesting results when interfaced with cheap $10 hardware.There are many consumer items that fall under the umbrella of IoT and while it may be hard to understand the impact of hacking a toaster, we can all agree that manipulation of a medical device could lead to rather serious consequences. Apart from putting a patient's life at risk, an attacker could compromise a healthcare device to steal patient data. This presentation will primarily focus on the latter with real-world examples and a case study. We will demonstrate the compromise of a healthcare device to steal medical records, which typically include PII, health insurance data, medical history, SSNs, prescriptions etc.",

More often than not, these extensions are abused for standard crimeware activities, such as ad click fraud, cryptocurrency mining, or stealing banking credentials. But this is only scratching the surface of what is possible if the appropriate browser APIs are abused. Extensions can act as a foothold into a target's internal network, provided a single user can be convinced to click two buttons. As a post-exploitation mechanism, extensions can be side-loaded with the ability to read and write files to disk. These actions will all be performed from the browser process(es) and likely go undetected by conventional endpoint protection solutions.

Once this system is joined to Active Directory, however, does that static trust model remain the same? Or has the number of attack paths to your data increased by an order of magnitude? We\u2019ve spent the last year exploring the access control model of Active Directory and recently broadened our focus to include security descriptor misconfigurations/backdoor opportunities at the host level. We soon realized that the post-exploitation \u201cattack surface\u201d of Windows hosts spans well beyond what we originally realized, and that host misconfigurations can sometimes have a profound effect on the security of every other host in the forest. This talk will explore a number of lesser-known Active Directory and host-based permission settings that can be abused in concert for remote access, privilege escalation, or persistence. We will show how targeted host modifications (or existing misconfigurations) can facilitate complex Active Directory attack chains with far-reaching effects on other systems and services in the forest, and can allow new AD attack paths to be built without modifying Active Directory itself.",

WMI attacks CAN be detected, and everyone should understand how to search for, detect, and all the Fu that goes along with WMI attacks.  The reason? By default, Windows does log much to detect WMI exploitation, so there is some work to do you need to know about. This talk will show a few examples of WMI exploitation, what and why it can be detected, what you need to configure to catch attacks, what additional things you will need to hunt for WMI pwnage across your environment.

We'll explore some existing mindsets and open the door to unconventional backgrounds. Where does our communal knowledge benefit by drawing from more sources to enhance our big picture? What can we gain from where we aren\u2019t we looking? We'll look at how we see ourselves within this community. Imposter syndrome and elitism are two sides of the same coin. What are the definitive benefits we derive as members of this collective? How do we find out who is part of our community? While our ability to close ranks against intruders is a strength, is it holding us back by holding us in? Infosec is more than a career. It\u2019s a community we call home, an extraordinary incubator of skill and talent that needs our help to keep growing. But to bring in the people we need, we have to think outside the box and draw a bigger circle.",

      "description": "Over the course of the last few years, PowerShell has been the number one way of conducting essentially any type of offensive operation on Active Directory networks and Windows endpoints. It allows offensive personnel to execute implants completely in memory, stealthily conduct situational awareness, and dynamically leverage the underlying power of .NET. Due to recent protections put in place by Microsoft, PowerShell is becoming increasingly less viable to use offensively. These protections are \"baked in\" to the latest versions of the Windows operating systems and allow AV/EDR/Logging solutions to gain an overwhelming amount of insight into PowerShell execution, and even, in some cases, completely shut down any type of malicious PowerShell tooling/tradecraft. It\u2019s been a good run, and PowerShell has served us well. However, the future is upon us, and it's our job to adapt; we have to go deeper! With that in mind, what if I told you that everything PowerShell does can also be done with Python--without dropping anything to disk and bypassing every protection that Microsoft has put in place for PowerShell? Welcome to the wonderful world of IronPython, where rainbows and unicorns *still* gallivant as if it were 2009!  In this talk, we will be looking at my approach to solving the tradecraft problem of gaining complete, unrestricted, and dynamic access to the .NET runtime without going through PowerShell in any way. I'm going to be walking through the entire process of how I discovered this possibility existed, starting from \"not knowing what I'm doing\" and going to a \"somewhat understanding of what I'm doing\". The talk will cover the progression from creating an initial weaponization PoC all the way up to building an Implant/C2 framework around it and all the success/failures/roadblocks I encountered along the way. Finally, at the end of the talk, I will be releasing the implant/C2 framework which I named SILENTTRINITY to the infosec community.",

In addition, the framework approaches threat analysis from a binary assessment of success vs. failure in order to see the entire attack and consider the potential for a number of methods and attempts made in a single attack.  A detailed methodology and sample charts are included for a reference and a starting point in developing one\u2019s own personalized charts, and recommendations are made for ways to integrate this methodology into the risk management process.",

Sometimes it is pretty tricky to maintain access on certain environments, especially when it is not possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to privileged groups, dumping credentials or hashes, deploying a persistent shell, or anything that could trigger an alert on the victim. This statement ratifies why it's necessary to use discrete and stealthy techniques to keep an open door right after obtaining a high privilege access on the target. What could be more convenient that only use OS resources in order to persist an access? This presentation will provide a new post-exploitation hook applicable to all Windows versions called RID Hijacking, which allows setting desired privileges to an existent account in a stealthy manner by modifying some security attributes. To show its effectiveness, the attack will be demonstrated by using a module which was recently added by Rapid7 to their Metasploit Framework, and developed by the security researcher Sebasti\u00e1n Castro.",

Thus, will call it what it is - Human Intelligence, also known as HUMINT.Presenting personal experiences as an Army counterintelligence agent with examples of military and industrial espionage, will examine tradecraft employed against individuals every day. We will apply lessons learned from the US military and the intelligence community by using two acronyms taught to Army counterintelligence agents: SAEDA (Subversion and Espionage Directed Against the Army) and MICE (Money, Ideology, Coercion, Ego). By presenting different aspects of HUMINT collection efforts will enable individuals to possibly detect, deflect, and protect oneself from such actions.",

I completely reverse engineered the malware, which runs with root privileges, hijacks all the HTTP traffic on the infected machine, and employs several other nefarious tricks. Due to some stunning opsec mistakes (which I will cover) I found the malware\u2019s authors downright to their full names and the company that they work for. Fast forward almost\u00a0two years later, OSX/Pirrit was back with a vengeance, employing new techniques and learning their lessons from everything I wrote about in my previous reports. Nevertheless, after lots of binary reverse engineering, going through thousands of lines of JavaScript, bash, and AppleScript code - I managed to reveal just how sinister the new version of OSX/pirrit is which is virtually impossible to remove without deep OSX knowledge. Due to more opsec mistakes by the authors I managed to tie this new wave of infections back to On top of that, TargetingEdge, the company who makes this adware/malware, bombarded us with cease and desist letters, threatening my employer and myself personally - trying to keep us from publishing our report.\u00a0In my talk I will highlight all of the methods that were used by the authors of the malware to abuse systems, I will guide the attendees through the process of reverse engineering such malware and share with everyone the amazing and hilarious story behind this whole incident.\u00a0There will be IDA screenshots, there will be stunning opsec mistakes by the authors and there will lolz galore.Join me for a session about reverse engineering, browser hooking tricks on OSX and interesting tales about my time with our corporate attorney battling these legal threats.\u00a0This talk is meant for beginners and experienced audiences alike as I intend to walk through all the phases of my research.

      "description": "Skilled attackers continually seek out new attack vectors and effective ways of obfuscating old techniques to evade detection. Active defenders can attest to attackers\u2019 prolific obfuscation of JavaScript, VBScript and PowerShell payloads given the ample availability of obfuscation frameworks and their effectiveness at evading many of today\u2019s defenses. However, advanced defenders are increasingly detecting this obfuscation with help from the data science community. This approach paired with deeper visibility into memory-resident payloads via interfaces like Microsoft\u2019s Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is causing some Red Teamers to shift tradecraft to languages that offer defenders less visibility. But what are attackers using in the wild? In the past year numerous APT and FIN (Financial) threat actors have increasingly introduced obfuscation techniques into their usage of native Windows binaries like wscript.exe, regsvr32.exe and cmd.exe. Some simple approaches entail randomly adding cmd.exe\u2019s caret (^) escape character to command arguments. More interesting techniques like those employed by APT32, FIN7 and FIN8 involve quotes, parentheses and standard input.The most interesting obfuscation technique observed in the wild was FIN7\u2019s use of cmd.exe\u2019s string replacement functionality identified in June 2017. This discovery single-handedly initiated my research into cmd.exe\u2019s surprisingly effective but vastly unexplored obfuscation capabilities. In this presentation I will dive deep into cmd.exe\u2019s multi-faceted obfuscation opportunities beginning with carets, quotes and stdin argument hiding. Next I will extrapolate more complex techniques including FIN7\u2019s string removal/replacement concept and two never-before-seen obfuscation and full encoding techniques \u2013 all performed entirely in memory by cmd.exe. Finally, I will outline three approaches for obfuscating binary names from static and dynamic analysis while highlighting lesser-known cmd.exe replacement binaries. I will conclude this talk by giving a live demo of my cmd.exe obfuscation framework called Invoke-DOSfuscation that obfuscates payloads using these multi-layered techniques. I will also share detection implications and approaches for this genre of obfuscation.",

Even today, many traditional methods will still frequently bypass firewalls and detection, and additional methods continue to be devised. But as an attacker, what do I do when my favorite method is blocked? What are my options other than reusing a stale python script from github or creating my own ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of a high-level messaging protocol? And as a defender, how can I measure my ability to detect the diverse C&C traffic that may be seen today, and also prepare for new and unexpected channels? In this talk, we will discuss the evolution of command and control methods, their strengths and weaknesses from an attacker's perspective, and the capabilities of a defender to detect and respond to them. We will identify what aspects a forward-thinking C&C framework might require, and then demonstrate a proof-of-concept with 99(ish) different interchangeable methods for communication. Finally, we will discuss some of the shortcomings of egress filtering in enterprise environments that should be addressed in order to mature our detection and response in kind.",

By reducing the capabilities and resources a container can utilize, we make it increasingly difficult to elevate privileges, gain persistence or move laterally within a cluster of containerized services. While Docker is the container technology most people are familiar with, there are other container types to think about too, each with their own opinionated take on security. It\u2019s getting increasingly common to adopt other runtimes through the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification using interfaces and shims provided by container orchestration platforms. Containers that use Linux namespaces and control groups for isolation typically provide weaker protections against escaping than hypervisor-based containers, further detaching security reality from your hopes and dreams. This presentation will focus on the security and kernel protections available in several popular Linux container technologies including Docker, Rkt, LXC, Kata and gVisor. We will explore how the default runtime security controls stack up under attack and how they attempt to isolate resources at security boundaries. We will explore the container hardening process through AppArmor, SELinux, Seccomp and Capabilities. At the end of this presentation, you\u2019ll be motivated to run minimally privileged containers that are isolated from doing any real damage.
