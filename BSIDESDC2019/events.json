      "description": "What goes into building a secure kubernetes cluster? Most of the reading you\u2019ll find focuses on TLS and container design. An area that is often overlooked is identity management. Who\u2019s accessing the cluster? Why do they need access? Do they still need access? Are they accessing the cluster using the correct credentials? In this class we\u2019ll build a kubernetes cluster with identity management as the primary focus. You\u2019ll learn how to:\r\n\r\n* Use centralized authentication for the nodes and masters at the host level\r\n* Integrate a running cluster with OpenID Connect\r\n* Automate the creation of network and pod security policies\r\n* Lock down access to the Kubernetes dashboard\r\n* Integrate Jenkins into your cluster and lock down its access\r\n\r\nIn addition to building your cluster, we\u2019ll explore how identity interacts through your pipeline and container registry strategies. By the time you\u2019re done with this class you\u2019ll have seen how identity and automation plays a crucial role in securing your clusters.",

The basic tools and techniques taught during this class can be used to investigate isolated security incidents or implemented at scale for continuous monitoring (SIEM) and threat hunting. Attendees will be provided with access to a preconfigured Elastic stack cluster and extensive sample logs containing malicious events waiting to be discovered on a simulated enterprise network. Attacker artifacts will be mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and tagged accordingly in the provided logs to help demonstrate the value of log enrichment, showcase both common and novel real-world attacker TTPs, and leverage a methodological approach to adversary and anomaly detection. Emphasis will be placed on live demos and practical training exercises throughout. The training will conclude with a friendly CTF tournament to give attendees the opportunity to collaborate and compete on teams in order to put their learning into practice and win some prizes.\r\n",

      "description": "OpenSOC is a DFIR challenge meant to teach practical incident response skills in an environment that very closely resembles a real enterprise network. This virtual environment is a scaled down version of what you would find in an enterprise network, including: workstations, servers, firewalls, email, web browsing, user activity, etc. Simulated users are browsing the Internet, downloading files, watching videos, and accessing LAN resources. This creates a high fidelity training environment for unleashing real-world attacks and testing a responders ability to filter out the noise and find malicious activity on the network.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just another CTF. We\u2019ve built this platform to train real-world responders to handle real-world situations.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even better? 100% of the security tools demonstrated on OpenSOC are FREE and OPEN SOURCE! These projects include Wazuh + ossec, Kolide + osquery, Suricata, Snort, Moloch, OPNsense, pfSense and Graylog bringing it all together in an awesome way.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge:\r\n\r\n1) Given an initial IOCs (indicator of compromise (or pivot point)), identify attacks that are being carried out against and within the enterprise environment. 2) Trace the attackers throughout the kill chain, submitting key IOCs and observables to the scoreboard as you reveal their tactics. 3) Reverse engineer any artifacts connected to hostile activities. 4) Perform forensics analysis on PCAPs (Packet Captures), memory images, etc. 5) Win awesome prizes, learn new skills, and get experience with some of the best OPEN SOURCE tools for SecOps!",

      "description": "The Ethernet kind of networking; no talking to your neighbors required! (But we're all hackers here, so you should at least think about making a friend or two!)\r\n\r\nInfosec professionals unanimously agree that network security is a must to protect organizational assets. That's nice and all, but what about your assets? Many consumer-grade routing appliances provide a limited set of functions to secure the resources behind them, but enterprise-grade networking hardware comes with an enterprise-grade price tag. What's a hacker to do? Enter: the aptly-named \"pro-sumer\"-grade hardware. While there are multiple hardware devices that fit this label, this training course will focus on the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X; neither of your trainers are paid, sponsored or affiliated with Ubiquiti in any way, we just really like its balance between features and cost.\r\n\r\nIn this course, we'll go over all of the features of the EdgeRouter X and how those features can be used to protect the devices on your home network. Ubiquiti has pretty good documentation, but knowing the \"why\" and \"when\", along with the \"how\", is critical for ANY new hardware or software deployment in order for the end user to take full advantage of the product.\r\n\r\nThe full set of topics we'll cover can be found below:\r\n\r\n1. Connecting to the configuration interface\r\n2. Basic Setup Hygiene\r\n3. Traffic Analysis\r\n4. Routing\r\n5. Firewall\r\n6. NAT\r\n7. Port Forwarding\r\n8. DNS\r\n9. VPN\r\n10. Packet Capture\r\n11. The Configuration Tree\r\n12. Mastering the Balancing Act Between Features & Performance\r\n13. CLI Overview\r\n\r\nWe encourage anyone who's interested to join us, but those who are looking to enhance their home network security posture on a budget without jumping into the world of DD-WRT will find this training particularly useful.",

      "description": "There is a new ecosystem underway that will impact everyone, especially the irritated people in the U.S. who have received more than 48 billion robocalls last year. This new ecosystem will hopefully put an end to these annoying and fraudulent robocalls calls, which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates will constitute more than half of all phone calls placed in the U.S. this year. The FCC and major telecommunications companies including Comcast, AT&T, and T-Mobile are behind a new, global technology standard called SHAKEN/STIR (Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information using ToKENs and Secure Telephony Identity Revisited) to combat robocalls and caller ID spoofing. This new standard addresses the issue of commercial robocallers who are impersonating other callers and committing fraud via Caller ID.\r\n\r\nPublic key infrastructure (PKI) is the backbone of the SHAKEN/STIR global technology standard. In order to build this new ecosystem to facilitate stronger identities for each and every call generated, an effective PKI ecosystem must be implemented. Strong identities and controls will be needed to ensure call identities are trusted globally. PKI is the technology that will be used to identify and verify each phone call. SHAKEN/STIR will shift the identity details from the call originator to the trusted telephone company routing the call. The industry \u2013 technology infrastructure, telecommunications, and government entities \u2013 needs to work together on a solution that will reduce fraud and put an end to robocalls. As this technology standard evolves and deployed, it is important to identify the security risks telecommunications companies will face and how enterprises can benefit from this work. Security will be required at every level of SHAKEN/STIR implementation.",

      "description": "Despite applying more automation than ever before to detection and response operations, organizations continue to be challenged by relatively unsophisticated attacks. Reliable detection requires time-consuming analysis and a level of data aggregation and correlation that is at best an art, and at worst cost-prohibitive. Meanwhile, attackers remain agile and inventive, continually (and rapidly) changing their infrastructure and approach with minimal costs and maximum benefit.\r\n\r\nWhile there are some things computers do far better than humans \u2013 rote, repetitive tasks and complex calculations \u2013 we will always be masters of analysis given our ability for complex thought, decision-making, and visual learning. With the introduction of security automation and orchestration to the defensive tool set, blue teams can now automate some of their investigative playbooks and save precious cycles. Unfortunately, this capability often drives automation for its own sake and expands already monolithic tool sets, rather than actually empowering our humans. Simply doing analysis faster is only a small part of the solution.\r\n\r\nHow can we reframe this problem to alter the calculus of attack and defense? Automation for the sake of doing so is a common trap that can actually degrade our capabilities and waste defensive cycles. However, automation with the intent of providing context and guided workflow can be a game changer for defenders. With proper planning and an incremental, modular approach to automation in areas such as rapid research, contextualization, and decision support, we can measurably improve our defenses and start leveling the playing field.",

Plus you control physical access to your devices, so you can be reasonably certain you're secure. Victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations often don't have the luxury of keeping their passwords secret or denying root-level access to their adversary. They're faced with the ultimate insider threat- one that knows everything about them, has complete access to their digital life, and can even dictate their security policy. For them, their proximity to their attacker means that many security solutions are ineffective and, in some cases, even harmful to implement. This talk will explore cases where traditional security measures fail an already-vulnerable population, how we need to rethink our approach to security, and what we can do to help.",

Due to the large number of possible threats and related information generated each day, analysis time of each entry in the feed - with respect to its severity and impact - can take hours after time of first sighting. Using our Integrated Adaptive Cyber Framework (IACD), we implement flexible automation in the networks of three banks - MasterCard, Huntington, and Regions Financial - to decrease average response time from roughly 6 hours to under 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nWorking in conjunction with the Financial Service Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) and the banks, we use Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) to parse raw threat intelligence into standardized Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), which common security orchestration tools can intake and respond to. As part of our threat intelligence parsing, we utilize external enrichment tools to provide a relevant \"score\" of how severe a particular IoC may be. Providing a central feed of parsed, enriched IoCs allows security orchestration tools to make good, consistent judgements on how best to respond to an incoming threat, taking into account possible impact to the specific network in management. We touch on the importance of automation making non-damaging changes to the configuration of the network (e.g. we should not accidentally block a commonly-used domain).",

The momentary euphoria of catching up on your Twitter feed hardly alleviates the more frequent anxiety of being behind on infosec \u201cnews\u201d when work and life get busy. While there are many tools for aggregating and searching social media content, none of them are designed to identify and extract quality data for a particular topic. Our research shows that only 30% of Tweets by infosec-focused accounts are original content and only a fraction of those provide actionable information. Are you new to security and want to know where to find the most original and timely social media posts? Do you want data-driven answers to who the real influencers are in our field? What about those practitioners who are doing great work, but are flying under the radar? In this talk, we will demonstrate tools we have built to address these questions and derive contextually relevant value from more social media sources in less time. We will also be sharing details about soon to be available public access to the tools and plans for ongoing feature additions and refinements. With so many people doing and sharing amazing work, why miss out on content that would be impactful to you, because you weren\u2019t following the right person, had a busy day, or didn\u2019t have the budget or time to go a conference?",

      "description": "Until now, the techniques used for backdooring and code injection in PE files have been restricted mainly to the following:\r\n\r\n* Finding code-caves, injecting the malicious code in those code-caves, changing the entry-point of the program to point to these code caves.\r\n* Adding a new section to the PE file, adding malicious code to the section, making the section executable.\r\n\r\nThese approaches impose restrictions on the size of code that can be injected and they\u2019re extremely prone to identification by endpoint detection systems. The endpoint detection systems can:\r\n\r\n* verify whether the sizes of various sections mentioned in the section table match with their actual sizes in the PE file.\r\n* check for unusual section names in the PE file to identify sections that have been appended to the end of the PE file.\r\n* check the section table for permissions granted to various sections of the PE file to identify sections other than .text or other standard section that have been granted suspicious permissions.\r\n\r\nThis is where PErfidious comes into play. PErfidious is a Python3 tool that aims to directly take a benign PE executable and malicious shellcode, transform the malicious shellcode and inject the transformed shellcode into various parts of the executable\u2019s .text section, thus completely avoiding the need to look for code-caves or creating additional sections. After injection, PErfidious recalculates the size of the .text section and all the virtual address changes caused by the increase in the size of the .text section and modifies respective fields in the PE header, thus making sure that the PE file doesn\u2019t look injected.",

We will be teaching about logic and how it helps with many decisions in life. We will be talking about Terminal Quest and using that to learn the basics of Linux. We will be talking about how drones and other toys can teach us to code as well. We are going to teach how to ask questions properly to get the answers we are looking for from adults, but at a level that we understand. We will be taking a field trip out into the Vendor Area\u2019s where we will put these new skills into practice. We will learn how to \"hunt\" foxes - wireless foxes that is!

      "description": "The number one question every single network detection person gets asked: how do you deal with encrypted traffic? Threat actors leverage encryption to obfuscate their activities, sneaking past the border guards in their enchanted cloak, leveraging legitimate certificates or even worse, legitimate services to operate their C2. In 2017, a method for fingerprinting SSL clients and servers was released titled JA3 and JA3s respectively and with their release, network detection engineers rejoiced. JA3/JA3S seeks to profile the client and server software involved in an SSL/TLS session through fingerprinting their \u201chello\u201d messages and the involved cryptographic exchange. This method is not without its\u2019 nuances and in our experience putting it to the use, the nuances are critical to understand. This talk will give insights into our challenges, failures and successes with JA3 and JA3S while sharing tips for those seeking to begin using it for network detection.Z",

      "description": "Organizations across the globe are looking for ways to use MITRE ATT&CK TM in their environment, but are unsure how or where to start. Our team is constantly receiving requests to teach their analysts how to relate reports to ATT&CK; it's a time-consuming process with a steep learning curve. We get it, reading reports line-by-line to search for adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and then verifying if those behaviors align to documented TTPs in ATT&CK is challenging. As ATT&CK team members who do this daily, we thought that there has to be a better way. Using our ATT&CK experience, Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and some WebDev, we created the Threat Report ATT&CK Mapping (TRAM) tool to automatically extract TTPs from a prose report.\r\n\r\nSo why should you care? Not only will this tool help the ATT&CK team keep our public repository of Groups and Software updated with the latest cyber trends and attacker methodologies, but it can help your internal organizations too. TRAM can analyze multiple reports, map them to ATT&CK, and provide insight to your overall threat landscape and security posture. This enables defenders to test whether current tools and procedures are effectively defending against their most common threats, while also allowing red teams to develop prioritized adversary emulation plans with these TTPs in mind.\r\n\r\nThis talk will review our methodology, discuss our challenges, and demonstrate how you can use the tool for your own organization. With the open-source release of this tool, anyone can go from an ATT&CK zero to hero in no time!",

      "description": "Every day we give more and more of ourselves to big companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Samsung and many others. Every day more and more IoT devices enter our homes with cameras and microphones. And every day it is made easier for us to spy on one another with under the guise of \u201cparental controls.\u201d Can any of us reclaim our privacy? Yes, but it will not be handed back; it is something that we have to take. Use Tor, Use Signal is no longer enough and by implementing some of these tools and techniques in your daily life; you too can take back your privacy.",

      "description": "The recent rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), and especially machine learning (ML), entices many cybersecurity professionals into believing these popular techniques are a silver bullet solution to our biggest cybersecurity challenges. Unfortunately, many cyber efforts focus more on using data-driven ML without a clear strategy to carefully measure results derived from the models. Furthermore, AI is an area of advanced computer science that requires experienced analysis, careful data preparation, and measured expectations of model performance and risks. However, it is oftentimes used as a synonym for automation.\r\n\r\nDeloitte has performed enterprise-scale cyber analytics at the performance level of 1M events per second / 300B events per month for the last several years. In performing these analyses, Deloitte developed several advanced cyber analytic workflows that utilize ML, contextual enrichment, and data science to support mission-centric cyber hunt operations. Experience has shown analytical workflows are more impactful and relevant when they are defined not by the models used, but by the mission-oriented results they produce.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we describe a results-driven perspective of AI and ML applicable to real-world challenges in cyber analytics with a particular focus on detection of malicious actors and behaviors as well as advanced network understanding. We will discuss how analytical workflows utilize AI models and other techniques to define normal and anomalous behaviors; manage the base rate fallacy; integrate cyber-domain knowledge into data-driven models to provide context and explainability; and provide advanced decision-support to human cyber operators and threat hunters.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude our talk with stories of where AI has effectively supported cybersecurity analysis, where AI has failed in cybersecurity and analytic applications, and recommendations for moving beyond current data-driven AI models focused on classification and toward results-driven AI approaches which are robust to contextualization, uncertainty, and ambiguity in the cyber security domain.",

      "description": "Applications on macOS use a common and flawed method of loading dynamic libraries (dylib), which leaves them vulnerable to a post-exploitation technique known as dylib hijacking. Dylib hijacking is a technique used to exploit this flawed loading method in order to achieve privilege escalation, persistence, or the ability to run arbitrary code. This talk provides an overview of the attack vector and the process involved in exploiting vulnerable applications. Additionally, the process of automating the exploitation of vulnerable applications will be demonstrated and discussed in depth. The tools developed and used for this demonstration will be made publicly available.",
