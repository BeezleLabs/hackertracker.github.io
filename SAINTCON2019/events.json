Security consultants, especially pentesters, use a lot of specific tools and have many different requirements. With a standard Ubuntu or Fedora install it can take a lot of time to install all those tools manually and setup configurations. Images can become outdated quickly, or you may have varying hardware and disk sizes you need to be able to get installs done on. It gets a lot more difficult if you want the process to be repeatable. Fortunately, there are tools and scripts to help with this process. In this talk I will be going over the tools, scripts, virtual environments, containers, and other methods I've found that help to streamline the process to go from a reliable and standard Linux distribution to having all the tools you need installed and working, including tools from Git repositories, as well as all your customizations.",

      "description": "The Secure Socket API: How to Make Secure Sockets with as little as one line of code SSL/TLS libraries are notoriously hard for developers to use, leaving system administrators at the mercy of buggy and vulnerable applications. We demonstrate a new API we have developed, which modifies the standard POSIX socket API to vastly simplify how a developer interacts with TLS, while also giving administrators the ability to control applications and tailor TLS configuration to their needs. We first assess OpenSSL and its uses in open source software, recommending how this functionality should be accommodated within the POSIX API. We then demonstrate the Secure Socket API (SSA), a minimalist TLS API built using existing network functions and show how it can be employed by existing network applications by modifications requiring as little as one line of code. We next describe our SSA implementation that leverages network system calls to provide privilege separation and support for other programming languages. We end with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of the SSA and our accompanying implementation, describing the status of our implementation and ongoing efforts to improve it.",

It raises some questions about how relevant NSM is such as: What value does NSM bring in an age where so much traffic is encrypted? Can organizations still find intrusions and breaches by monitoring encrypted traffic? What strategies are organizations employing to gain security insights into such traffic? In addition to answering these questions, we consider other purposes of network monitoring such as how it supports cybersecurity frameworks and strengthens an organization's security posture especially in environments with decentralized or shadow IT. Finally, we highlight the power of decryption. General principles are discussed supported by practical and technical examples found in Palo Alto firewalls and Zeek.",

      "description": "Have you heard your friends or colleagues talk about \"sniffing\" network traffic? Do you want to know if that new \"smart\"-X device is actually just a way for companies to \"steal\" more of your private information. Find out what is really happening on your networks with this introduction to Wireshark, one of the most popular tools used in industry for network analysis. No prior knowledge is necessary. We will start with a brief introduction to Wireshark, its capabilities and uses. Next, we will discuss where and how to monitor your network with Wireshark and what factors affect those decisions. At this point we are now ready to start applying capture filters, display filters, and custom colorization rules to highlight the information we are interested in seeing. We will focus on understanding several popular network protocols including ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP and others. We will also take a look at recently disclosed vulnerability such as the DNS rebinding attacks targeting Roku, Google Home and other devices. The entire workshop will be very hands on with many different sample captures to work from as we identify both normal and abnormal traffic. We will not be doing any live captures.",

      "description": "In spring, 2019, Sophos detected a widespread ransomware attack using a malware that calls itself MegaCortex. The ransomware was spread around victims' networks using compromised Domain Admin credentials on domain controller computers to distribute it as if it were a software patch, using WMI. Subsequent analysis into both the attack and the malware itself showed the attack killchain was orchestrated using complex (and somewhat redundant) Windows batch files. The malware also featured a number of anti-analysis features, including a password string that was unique to the sample, and a hardcoded \"active\" time that analysts discovered: samples would not run in sandboxes unless the system date was changed to a three-hour window starting at around the same time the original attack began. But the MegaCortex phenomenon actually raised more questions than answers. There are significant similarities between the code style and behavior of other malware families in the MegaCortex samples we initially examined. There were also odd connections and false flag ties to completely unrelated malware families that sent researchers down a number of dead end rabbit holes. None of the questions of why the malware had these unique characteristics have been answered, and the low key nature of MegaCortex may mean we'll never understand its creators' motives.",

      "description": "The world of information security spends much of its time focused on looking forward, trying to tackle the bleeding edge of malicious code and obfuscation, which is as it should be. Lost in the rapid pace of technological adaptation in the malware arms race is a sense of history: the origins of malware and its earliest days. How did malware get its start, and what lessons can today's defenders learn about the origins of malicious code, back from the days when analysts first coined the term \"virus\" as a binary analogue to biological illness? To learn more about malware's origins, we obtained samples of some of the oldest extant malicious code and devised ways of putting that malware onto the retro storage media required by the computers that were the earliest malware victims. With the assistance of the Media Archaeology Lab, an educational museum of retro computing based at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the author executed those samples on real, physical retrocomputing devices like the Apple II, the Commodore 64, an IBM PC 5150, and early Apple Lisa and 68k Macintosh computers running Mac OS System 7. Running malware on ancient computer systems is no different from using modern virtual or physical testbeds for detonation: you need to do it safely, in a \"detonation chamber\" of sorts, so the author and other volunteers also had to devise methods of safely moving the infected code from device to device or storage medium to storage medium, without spreading the infection to hard drives or other floppy disks or cassette tapes, or potentially damaging irreplaceable software or hardware. Finally, we analysed these malware samples using both modern reverse engineering tools, and the rudimentary analysis utilities that would have been available in the era (roughly 40 years ago, on average) in which the computers used in the study were still contemporary devices, to see what we could learn about this ancient malicious code, and whether it bears any resemblance to modern malware. The author believes the malicious code of the present day bears a more-than-passing resemblance to the malware of prior eras. If studying dinosaur bones contributes to science's understanding of evolutionary processes and biology, the study of retromalware surely can contribute to our modern understanding of sophisticated threats, and may help plan countermeasures against future ones.",

      "description": "Generally, the effectiveness of any security operations center is largely determined by the level of efficiency demonstrated when analyzing, responding to, and remediating threats across its stewardship. However, with limited personnel, resources, and time, even inefficiently accomplishing these tasks can be daunting. Due to the asynchronous nature of cybersecurity threats, manual monitoring and even polling-based functionalities are quickly becoming ineffective to counter the increased sophistication of bad actors. The emergence of event-driven microservices in IT represent a growing desire for organizations to increase efficiency, awareness, and organization throughout the enterprise. These same benefits are especially applied to security, an inherently event-driven environment. Converting to an event-driven/microservice architecture however, can quickly become a chaotic mess of interdependent services. Especially in large enterprises where uniformity is not always guaranteed and hybrid infrastructures exist, a flexible design is needed to maintain consistency, in addition to providing the benefits of a microservice architecture. In order to facilitate and coordinate security functionality across three distinct institutions/IT environments, the Church Educational System (CES) Security Operations Center at Brigham Young University decided to adopt an event-driven microservice architecture. In this presentation we will describe the challenges, benefits, and applications of this architecture. Specifically, we will detail our evolution toward event-driven security, the requirements necessary for us to effectively transition, and how we are currently using this architecture to enable security functionality throughout the enterprise.",

With the melding of technology and human anatomy, implanted users can take advantage of this new field using it for information storage, authentication, and information access. Last year at Defcon, the authors were implanted with NFC and RFID devices to do some hands-on (literally) research into using embedded (literally) NFC/RFID bio-implants for fun and profit. We looked at everything from paying with the implant, to getting unlimited plays at video arcades. We also examined using the implants as an attack surface. We will show our research into using NFC and RFID implants to gain access to certain electronics. We will discuss several failed attempts at using implants as an attack vector. Finally, a method will be presented that demonstrates how a person implanted with an NFC chip can get access to a phone by merely holding it.",

      "description": "Training is limited to 40 people. Training is first come first serve!!!\n\nLearn how to take control of Windows and Linux servers running vulnerable software, in a hands-on CTF-style workshop. We begin with easy command injections and SQL injections, and proceed through binary exploits including buffer overflows on the stack and the heap, format string vulnerabilities, and race conditions. After this workshop, you will understand how memory is used by software, and why computers are so easily tricked into executing bytes as code that entered the system as data. Previous experience with C and assembly language is helpful but not required. Participants will need a laptop with VMware, or a credit card and a few dollars to rent cloud servers.\n\nTraining is limited to 40 people. Training is first come first serve!!!",

We'll identify the potential uses for the Homelab, as well as the pitfalls that we've run into along the way (noise, power usage, wife acceptance factor, etc.) The advantages of a Homelab are obvious, but sometimes it takes a little help knowing on how and where to get started.

      "description": "This live demo will reenact an infiltration to an organization's network. We will follow the attacker's footsteps to learn how they gain access to a desktop and the internal environment, then discuss how each part of the attack could have been detected and/or prevented. We begin by taking control of a user's desktop using one of a few common techniques and connecting it to a command-and-control center for the rest of the attack. Next, we steal passwords and documents, copy screen and email content, install a keylogger, record sound and stream webcam, control the mouse and keyboard, modify anti-malware settings, execute programs, reshape network traffic, and create a hidden, persistent data exfiltration channel. Time allows, we'll perform network reconnaissance and take over other computers, bypassing MFA and network segregation restrictions. This interactive demonstration will be rendered in a simulated, but fully operational, corporate setting. Our objective is to carefully examine and understand the attack procedures step-by-step, and then detail several defensive strategies against them.",
