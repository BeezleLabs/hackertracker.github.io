Her research interests include protecting consumer data privacy from third-parties, limiting the effectiveness of mass-surveillance techniques, and promoting anti-censorship technologies and protocols. After two years in a PhD program, she's pretty convinced that nothing is secure and never will be and that the human species really took the Stone Age for granted. She's grateful for the Internet that allows her to play video games with friends and still can't wrap her head around the fact that most of the giants in computer science are still living. Her heroes include her mother and caffeine. She hates lima beans and public speaking."

      "description": "I started tinkering with webpage vulnerabilities when I was around 17 years old. I had no clue it was a real job. I was soon, purposefully, infecting my own computers with spyware to see what happens and how they work. Then I joined the military (around 19 years old) as a Signals Intelligence Analyst (National Guard 2003, active duty Army 2005, and ended my career last year in the reserves).\nI've done some threat targeting downrange in Afghanistan and Iraq and even more targeting back here stateside. \nI left the targeting-focused world for a short time when I worked at the Department of Energy as their Senior Reverse Engineer. \nCurrently, I am working at Fidelis as a Principal Threat Researcher.\nAs you can see, my career grew up in the shadows of digital conversations. I saw and learned so much.\nA target is a target - human or digital."

In this talk, Sarah shares how - as a contrary teenager - she definitely didn't do what everyone will tell you to do career-wise but still managed to build a successful security career, and how we need to embrace individuals with non-linear careers to address the skills shortage in cyber."
