We can leverage ML to accelerate the work of the offensive researcher looking for fuzzing->crashes->exploit chains.\n\nCurrent techniques are built using sets of heuristics. We hypothesized that we can train an ML system to do as well as these heuristics, faster and more accurately.\n\nMachine Learning is not the panacea for every problem, but an exploitable crash has multiple data points (features) that can help us determine its exploitability. The presence of certain primitives on the call stack or the output of libraries and compile-time options like libdislocator, address sanitizer among others, can be indicators of \"exploitability\", offering us a path to a greater, more generalized insight.\n\nA demo would be shown live on stage (and if the gods permit, a tool released)!",

The progression of debuggers and malware is akin to a game of cat and mouse - each are constantly in a state of trying to thwart one another.  At the core of most efficient debuggers today is a combination of virtual machines and traditional binary modification breakpoints (int3).  In this paper, we present a design for Virtual Breakpoints --- a modification to the x86 MMU which brings breakpoint management into hardware alongside page tables.  In this paper we demonstrate the fundamental abstraction failures of current trapping methods, and rebuild the mechanism from the ground up.  Our design incorporates the lessons learned from 40 years of virtualization and debugger design to deliver fast, reliable trapping without the pitfalls of traditional binary modification.",

We already know USB devices might try to automatically run code when connected, or act like a hyperactive keyboard and mouse, or attempt to physically destroy the host, or masquerade as an innocent charging/data cable.  But it can, actually, get worse.  Say hello to the Loki Drive, a USB drive with just a little too much chaotic energy.  I'll demonstrate how a USB mass storage device can change the storage it presents to the host computer based on a set of user-defined conditions.  On the offensive side this can be used to circumvent USB scanning procedures and on the defensive side this can be used to store private files that will be undetectable without time-consuming analysis.

Sweet, let's do that.\n\nLess well known but similarly prevalent are Flat Package Mac OS X Installer (.pkg) files.

To drive the point home of what can go wrong, I'll include examples of security issues I've seen in the wild and show how they can be exploited to elevate privileges and gain code/command execution.\n\nAfter this talk, .pkg files will no longer be opaque blobs to you. You'll walk away knowing tools and techniques to examine, understand what they're really doing, and a methodology for finding bugs in them. As a final bonus, I'll include a subtle trick or two that can be used on red teams.",

Invasive and non-invasive BMIs now augment operators in many walks of life. Neuroimplants treat an range of neurological and psychiatric conditions: traditionally chronic pain, depression, Parkinson's, and recently obesity and drug addiction. Advances in neural and neuronal interface now allow direct connections to machinery (computers, robotics, cars, artificial limbs, etc.) providing either human control of the machine, or introduction of machine data into the human. Apple iOS devices are two years into being the largest digital ecosystem to directly support information feeds to brain-connected implants A patent search reveals that over 3800 patents were filed for BMI technology in 2018 alone. Entirely new attack surfaces are therefore available to be exploited by malicious cyber-criminals, making the security of these devices of paramount importance, and not a consideration to be ignored until these attacks have already occurred.This presentation will chronicle and categorize present and near-future threats, known and potential countermeasures, and cut through hyperbole and sensationalism to expose and discuss the reality of the emerging neurosecurity landscape.",

Turing-completeness allows shellcode to avoid suspicious behavior such as calling system(3) and to return control to the target process.\n\nAs input, ROPC accepts (i) source files written in so-called ROPC-IR, (ii) rules for translating ROPC-IR instructions to sequences of gadget addresses, and (iii) static configuration parameters about the victim process. As output, it produces a two-stage shellcode (a sequence of gadget return addresses) that can be injected onto the target process' stack.\n\nThe distinguishing features of ROPC is its emulation of a second stack available to the ROP shellcode and its consequent support for nondestructive invocation of library and system calls (with variable parameters) as well as shellcode subroutine calls.",

In this talk I will discuss how my security team and I respond to modern intrusions from Red Team engagements and \"IRL' threats that no longer follow the \"Classic' methodologies of attack. If you're a defender that's tired of hearing about Powershell, sysmon, mimkatz, and \"Red Teaming 101', this may be for you. This talk is primarily targeted at incident responders working in complex, modern, environments and aims to provide practical guidance on improving your teams capability to detect bad actors and respond to intrusions in 2019 and beyond.",

However, as the modern browsers are being automatically patched and endpoint protection improves, depending on either a browser 0day or the victim to click and deploy a malware on his machine narrows down attacker's opportunities. But did you ever wonder how could someone obtain access to internal network by only relying on the victim's browser as the main weapon?  \n \nIn this talk, we will propose an attack concept that brings a whole new attack surface to infiltrate internal networks. The attack will work even on the latest patched browsers and without deploying any malware. By combining and advancing existing concepts of JavaScript reconnaissance techniques and DNS rebinding attacks, internal applications could be now exposed to the outside world while going unnoticed.\n\nWe will explain how going from theory to practice requires overcoming several limitations of the current DNS rebinding attack. We will go through the steps of evolving the current possibilities into establishing a full tunnel to internal network applications. We will tackle the challenges with handling all HTTP methods, proxying authentication and downloading binaries via the tunnel.",

Similarly, investigations are based on searches over isolated events - an alert fires and you manually try to find related events based on ad-hoc queries.\n\nGrapl aims to move beyond individual events as the fundamental abstraction and focus instead on relationships. Logs are parsed into graph representations and merged into a master graph representing all actions occurring across your environments. This approach allows for relationship-based detections and more efficient, ergonomic investigations.\n\nGrapl handles the work of turning logs into subgraphs, orchestrating signatures executing across the graph, and automatically scoping investigations through expansion of the graph.",

Misinformation is an information security problem in part because information technology and the internet are how misinformation messages are generated, transmitted and received.  Historically, large-scale misinformation (propaganda) has been the domain of nation-states, but the Internet has also enabled non-state actors to have effects formerly only available to nation-states. Additionally, the Internet has enabled nation-states to conduct influence campaigns in a new manner that is less attributable and can therefore be conducted without substantial risk of starting a war.  \n\nPower-motivated misinformation has been studied as an information security problem, information operations problem, a form of conflict, a social problem and a news source pollution.  Each of these studies uses a different framing and ontology; we cover the adaptation of existing information security frameworks and principles into a framework and common ontology for these communities to share information about misinformation campaigns incidents and conduct component-wise response to them.  We also describe the links between information operations, artefact-based data science and narrative analysis of misinformation campaigns.",

Importantly, they generalize well to new malware samples, evolving families and polymorphic strains.  However, often neglected is the fact that \"old-school\" signatures actually perform *better* at the narrow role for which they were designed: signatures detect *known* and well-behaved malware families at detection rates approaching 100% and false positive rates approaching 0%.  Should these not be a powerful complement to static malware detection using machine learning?\n\nI present automatic malware signature generation via n-grams, but with one significant upgrade: I consider ludicrously large n-grams for n up to 1024 using \"KiloGrams\", an approach co-developed by government, academic and industry partners.  Since memory burden using straightforward approaches grows exponentially with n, previous research for n>6 is exceedingly rare, and to our knowledge has never been attempted for n>8. But more than 1 in 50 observed x86 instructions exceed 6 bytes, so that a byte 6-gram is insufficient for capturing telling sequences.  KiloGrams discovers the K dominant n-grams (for very large n) with very modest memory requirements, and the resulting signatures provide both impressive predictive performance, and intrinsic interpretability.",

Rule-based whitelists are one attempt at circumventing these issues, but they can cause detection teams to miss legitimate attacks. For example, preventing alerts from being generated when both the source and destination of a network flow are inside the network boundary will obscure attackers proxying through internal hosts.\n\nWe demonstrate how modeling improves upon whitelists to solve the problem of inactionable alerts. For our detection models, we stack a new model answering the question, \"How likely is this event to be characterized as inactionable?\" in a policy layer. This serves two purposes: it deprioritizes alerts that are unable to be investigated because of detectable data correlation loss, and it acts as a blanket policy to suppress results which investigators will see and throw away as obvious false positives. We show how doing so drastically decreases our false positive rates while continuing to alert on truly suspicious events.",

Accepting this reality means organizations need to focus resources where they are most likely to be impactful. But this begs many questions: What types of hosts are most likely to have vulnerabilities? Are those same hosts critical parts of the business? What about cloud infrastructure that isn't fully controlled? Are hosts on foreign soil in compliance with local laws?\n\nWe could tap into prevailing FUD and personal opinions to answer these questions, but haven't we all had enough of that? We'd prefer to know what the data says. In this talk we introduce the concept of risk surface and explore its shape by tapping into a fascinating data set spanning millions of internet-facing hosts from tens of thousands of firms and major hosting providers around the world. We find that for most organizations risk is global with more than half locating infrastructure in multiple countries. Not only are hosts spread far and wide, but vulnerabilities are too: more than half of organizations have high or critical vulnerabilities on external infrastructure. Armed with this new perspective, we can make recommendations to organizations on where their resources are best deployed.",

These cleverly crafted inputs are designed to toe the line of classifier decision boundaries, and are typically constructed by slightly perturbing correctly classified samples until the classifier misclassifies it, even though the sample is largely the same. Researchers have published ways to construct these examples with full, some, or no knowledge of the target classifier, and have furthermore shown their applicability to a variety of domains, including in security.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss several experiments where we attempted to make Meterpreter - a well-known and well-signatured RAT - into an adversarial example. To do this, we leveraged the open-source gym-malware package, which treats the classifier as a black-box and uses reinforcement learning to train an agent to apply perturbations that result in evasive malware. Deviating from existing work, our approach trained the agent on differently-compiled versions of Meterpreter, as opposed to a large corpus of unrelated malware samples. The results of our experiments were underwhelming, showing little difference between our trained agent and random perturbations. However, further analysis of the results highlight interesting trends and areas for future research.",

New grads and non-grads struggle to get a foot in the door, so they never get those 8 years of experience. Google has made progress towards solving that problem. We created a team that hires people at entry level and grows them until they can take more senior jobs. The team manages operational security work, like exception requests, that senior engineers find boring but new engineers find interesting and educational. The team also writes code to automate away as much work as possible.\n\nWe've also created a feeder program to train non-security people up to entry level in security, and we've created a rotation program to transition software engineers into security. Together, these programs have resulted in many hires and promotions and multiple rising stars. Additionally, the team is substantially more diverse than average.\n\nAfter attending this talk, you\u2019ll understand how we achieved these results and how you can create a similar program in your own organization.",

To date, however, there has not been a widely accepted practice on how to assemble and communicate this data between those developing software and those securing it or using it. Without visibility into third party components, developing organizations cannot understand the deeper security risks in what they assemble, organizations lack insight into security risks from outdated or insecurely sourced open components in what they are building or buying, and security teams cannot easily and efficiently determine whether their systems are potentially at risk from newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n\nWhat was once heresy is becoming a reality!

Today, the Defense Digital Service\u2019s (DDS) \u2018Hack the Pentagon\u2019 program has run nearly twenty bug bounties across the Department of Defense, engaged thousands of ethical hackers, and uncovered thousands vulnerabilities.

While these programs are what DDS is best known for, the military also manages thousands of vehicles, ICS systems, and medical devices, in some of the most unique and challenging circumstances or any organization.   Hear from DDS Director and noted data scientist Brett Goldstein about going beyond checklists and attested security, shifting culture in the world's largest bureaucracy, and working to incorporate diverse perspectives and talent to contribute to our country. Under Brett, the DDS team is helping to push better security norms and best practices - recognizing talent, diverse perspectives, and creativity are critical to remaining a step ahead of our adversaries.

In this research, two websites with visual similarity are built: one resembles a legit website, the other one contains specific characteristics of phishing website (and thus resembles a phishing version of the earlier mentioned website). With a custom built API, mouse movements, mouse clicks and key presses were captured on both websites to record user behaviour. With this captured data, which resulted in more than 100.000 records, data science models were applied to find statistical relevance. And the results? Attend This Session And You Will Be Surprised!",

Achieving code injection is becoming more and more challenging as traditional techniques are now widely detected by various security solutions. I found a new injection-less method to inject code to a remote process. In this method I don't use any of the known methods to inject code. To achieve the injection-less injection the remote process is made to read data from the injecting process by calling ReadProcessMemory. This code injection works only on x86_64 architecture.\nIn addition to this method, I found another way to copy data in the remote process. By copying data inside the remote process, I can recreate a shellcode from the injecting process. The second method should work on x86 and x86_64 architectures.",

      "description": "In July 2018, over a decade after the DES encryption algorithm was retired, 3DES was also officially deprecated. While previous work suggests a successful deprecation of DES, with less than 1% of observed SSL/TLS handshakes using some form of DES up until 2018, such work tends to be limited in scope and does not necessarily capture the true persistence of DES across the entire TLS ecosystem. We actively investigate online support for DES and DES-derivative ciphers by querying IP addresses responsive to port 443 connection attempts. To achieve this, we design and implement our own Internet scanning tool built upon ZMap and attempt to negotiate handshakes exclusively using DES ciphers. In total, we have scanned over 24 million unique IP addresses and found that nearly half of them can still successfully establish an HTTPS connection using at least one DES cipher. Moreover, we also find that many servers still support DES40 (which can be broken in seconds) and anon ciphers (which offer no certificate verification and are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks). Our investigation demonstrates the biases and misunderstandings in previous weak cipher studies within the TLS ecosystem, and discloses the severity of this problem by targeting DES-based cipher suites.",

In the case of sophisticated attacks like an APT, however, we can benefit significantly if we can observe how the adversary performed their attack and understand their TTPs and eventually their purposes and intentions. To realize these benefits, the observation needs to be conducted safely and covertly so that the adversary continues the attack. \nWe propose a new technique that transfers the attack to a safe observation environment without alerting the adversary so that we can keep observing their activity in real time. We propose first to prepare the Deception Network (D-Net) configured identically to the Operational Network (O-Net). \nAfter a compromise is detected, the relevant network packets are modified so that communications between the compromised PC and the O-Net are seamlessly redirected into the D-Net, minimizing any further compromise of operational data and assets. In order to not let the adversary knows that their attack was transferred from the O-Net to the D-Net, we employ a sophisticated and unique packet rewriting technique using Software Defined Networking technology. \n",

Analysis of the passwords obtained from these hashes showed that many organisational passwords are based on the English language. This is understandable considering that the business language in South Africa is English even though South Africa has official 11 languages. African language based passwords were derived from known English weak passwords and some of the passwords were appended with numbers and special characters. The African based passwords were then uploaded to the Internet to test the security around using passwords based on African languages.Most of the passwords were able to be cracked by third-party researchers, we conclude that any password that is derived from known weak English words marked no improvement in the security of a password written in an African language,especially the more widely spoken languages.",

The user must provide a password in order to read the bank statement.\n\nMost banks in Mexico use a password protected ZIP file or a password protected PDF in order to obey the law. One particular bank took a different approach and used an HTML file to achieve the same job. In this presentation, I analyze, from a security standpoint, the behaviour of such new bank statement, a vulnerability that I found (and has been fixed) and I end the presentation with an explanation and a demo on how such vulnerability could be exploited to view a bank statement without knowledge of the password.",

The last of them were discovered and eradicated some time ago and the world is now living in an era of prosperity while the Auth Federation enjoys peaceful CVE-free times. However, while things seem to be running smoothly, new bugs are brewing at the core of major implementation libraries. This is probably the last chance for the evil empire to launch a world scale attack against the Auth Federation. \n\nIn this talk, we will present two new techniques: \n    1) A new breed of SAML implementation flaws that break XML signature validation and enable arbitrary modification of the SAML assertion, which enables attackers to authenticate as arbitrary users or grant themselves arbitrary authorization claims. Although any implementation may be affected by this flaw, we will show how it affects Microsoft Windows Identity Framework (WIF) applications, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) web services, and flagship products such as SharePoint and Exchange Servers. \n    2) A bug in the .NET crypto library, which may allow attackers to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the availability of code gadgets in the target server.",

We will then focus on their key assets, Programmable Logic Controllers, and discover how they work, how they communicate, how they can be programmed to learn the methods and tools you can use to p*wn them.\n\nThen we will move on to real-world by attacking real PLCs on a dedicated setup featuring robot arms and a model train! And to conclude, probably the most difficult, let's discuss how to secure ICS.",

CALDERA was originally released in 2017 as an R&D-heavy tool designed to run fully automated end-to-end adversary emulation exercises aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. In 2019, the team pushed out a major update featuring a completely redesigned core architecture - now letting users create \"plugins\" to extend functionality - as well as a new operating mode (\"chain\") that allows users to leverage CALDERA to orchestrate atomic unit tests without the overhead needed in the original release.\n\n\nIn this course, we'll teach participants the basics of CALDERA - focusing on chain mode - including how it works, its core design, and some of the ways it can be used. Then, we'll switch to hands-on mode where we'll guide attendees on how to use CALDERA, walking through its UIs and setting up and running built-in adversaries. Once attendees are familiar with the core concepts behind CALDERA, we'll run through exercises showing how it can be extended, including building new adversary profiles, adding techniques, and, time allowing, how to develop new plugins. Attendees should be familiar with the terminal and bring a laptop.",

As a collective we very rarely venture outside our information security silo. \n\nI will show how we can change from being self-indulgent and a tiny bit narcissistic to making us succeed in business arena. We speak security and risk with a very little or no business accent. We must learn to speak business with little or no IT accent. We must stop taking certifications and instead get business degrees. We must take the fight to the business and fight the battle on a business playing field.",

And what if I told you I could demonstrate the successful exploitation of these apps? In this talk, I will do precisely that. The results of successful exploitation can range from the relatively harmless \"stealing\" (or forging) of e-tickets to the critical exposure of customer PII information and account takeovers. \n\nOften, mobile apps are synonymous with thick clients - meaning they run locally and cannot trust their runtime, and come with the same vulnerabilities as their ancestors. As such, I will explore dynamic instrumentation using Frida and demonstrate practical use-cases to bypass security. \n\nDuring my presentation, you'll learn about the analysis of client-side obfuscation measures such as encrypted HTTP body and encrypted application storage (flat files/SQliteDb/Custom mobile SDK-based encryption) in mobile applications, which can be instrumental in uncovering security vulnerabilities.",

Card shops lower the barriers to entry for less-skilled criminals to facilitate card not present (CNP) fraud for online transactions. Rather than stealing the data themselves, all the criminals need to do is buy the card data from a card shop. The rise of Joker's Stash (2014) seems to correspond with the timeline of the rise of EMV in the U.S. The EMV Chip (and thus the decreased use of magnetic stripe) makes what were once tried-and-true tactics for in-store carding\u201a\u00c4\u00eei.e. skimmers & POS malware\u201a\u00c4\u00eemuch less feasible, criminals shifted towards CNP fraud, which is easier, and cheaper, and less resource intensive.

We will use this information to better understand targets of carders and carding shops, like Joker's Stash, and how to fight this growing form of fraud.",

      "description": "Chinese underground cybercrime profits exceeded US$15.1 billion in 2017, while causing more than $13.3 billion worth of damage relating to data loss, identity theft and fraud. Over the years, Chinese non-state threat actor groups have gradually transformed from small local networks targeting mostly Chinese businesses or citizens to larger and well-organized criminal groups capable of hacking international organizations. The development of commercial-scale exploit toolkits and criminal networks that focus on monetization of malware have amplified the growing risks of cybercrime in the region to include a DDoS attack against the People's Bank of China in December 2013, $1 billion SWIFT hack against Bangladesh Bank in February 2016, $14 million theft from Far Eastern International Bank in Taiwan in October 2017, to name just a few. How do the increased complexity and scope of attacks by Chinese non-state threat actors signal a new level of cyber threats emanating from China? How do Chinese cybercriminals compare to their Russian counterparts, and are they using a similar playbook? What is the impact on businesses in the Asia Pacific region and around the world? What new challenges do these developments pose against law enforcement agencies as they strive to detect, prevent, and mitigate cyberthreats?",
