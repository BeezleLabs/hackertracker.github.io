      "description": "In recent years, \u201cred teaming\u201d has become a market buzzword often prompting corporate excitement and weaving an image of \u201cpentesting\u201d in a red cape. This is unacceptable. The essence of red teaming is a healthy mix of \u201cGegenspiel\u201d (Adversarial Thinking) and \u201cKontraspiel\u201d (Adversarial Thought), terms coined by Dr. Mark Mateski of Red Team Journal.In the talk we will discuss how \u201cred teaming\u201d is not limited to the digital arena alone but includes physical and social vectors that should be considered for an effective operation. The social category does not only include social engineering but aspects such as history, philosophy, culture and art as well. In this talk, we will explain the logic behind these elements and their interconnection. We will discuss how these elements can provide significant intelligence when dealing with threat actors, and how they can additionally help craft a defense strategy. Drawing from examples and case studies from both the real and fictional world we will expand on Dr. Mark Mateski\u2019s concepts by applying both of them respectively to analyzing the character Grand Admiral Thrawn from the Star Wars universe and the way he successfully does his threat profiling and fusion of intelligence from a diverse number of sources. The parallelism with Grand Admiral Thrawn is considered to be an entertaining yet representative example of applying critical thinking in gathering and analyzing intelligence and conducting threat profiling.Examples from the real world will be provided throughout the presentation as well, showcasing how the elements discussed in the CHIMAERA model have significantly contributed in past cases.\r\n\r\nLastly, participants will have the option to participate in a \u201cdebrief\u201d. Participants will be provided with certain threat actors and they will be given a few minutes to research and to think critically to figure out why those threat actors do what they do, not in terms of the TTPs but in terms of their motivations, rationale, etc. Feedback will be provided right after.",

      "description": "Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems are comprised of a large variety of connected devices that are rife with \u201csmart\u201d features and textbook vulnerabilities. With the advent of ever growing interconnection and interoperability of all these devices, protocols that focus on automation have been developed throughout the years. These often assume an environment with cooperating participants \u2013 something that rarely happens in the real world. The fast market pace also leads manufacturers to marginalize security as having low return on investment. IoT devices are usually embedded with low-energy and low processing capabilities, deprioritizing security robustness as a result. All of the above combined make for ecosystems with lots of inherent weaknesses. In this talk we are going to present techniques and attacks on network protocols and insecure implementations commonly found in IoT ecosystems. We are going to explore how penetration testers can abuse zeroconf networking protocols like UPnP, mDNS, WS-Discovery and others to conduct a variety of attacks and how to combine a chain of seemingly lower risk findings into an impactful attack. Other IoT security angles will be explored as well: from the default insecurity of video streaming protocols like RTP, heavily used by networked cameras, to the growing usage of IPv6 and what that entails in terms of the security posture of the IoT world.\r\n\r\n",

These personal data access requests are usually managed by legal or compliance teams with minimal security review, increasing the potential for phishing, social engineering, and \u201clegal DDoS.\u201d This talk will discuss the personal data access options required in different regions, how most companies respond to data access requests, and the most effective exploits for privacy vulnerabilities. We\u2019ll explore the psychology driving corporate responses to requests and ways these emotions can be exploited, as well as the most likely targets for a weak privacy program.\r\n\r\nFor the blue teamers, phishing detection and defense strategies will be presented. Rather than ignoring or fighting against the regulations, we\u2019ll look at ways to use these laws to discourage, detect, and disrupt data access attacks. We\u2019ll consider strategies for working with legal teams, getting security involved in the review process, and conducting red team reviews on the data access mechanism. Best practices for identifying data subjects, minimizing the data released, and legally denying abusive requests will be covered. Key sections of the laws you need to know for exploits and defense will be highlighted.",
