This includes taking care of ourselves as trans and gender-fluid individuals, but also in sharing our stories and passions with the greater InfoSec world. I\u2019ll cover approaches to speaking with conference audiences, effective ways of holding fellow community members accountable, along with the necessity for intersectional equality and justice between race, gender, and other identifiers. I will also discuss strategies for introducing trans people to cyber, and how to support them once they\u2019ve arrived. Unity and solidarity should be our collective goal because if we don\u2019t maintain the work done to create a welcoming community within cybersecurity, we may lose what little shelter we have left.\r\n",

Future success in AI and ML depends on our ability to meet these challenges as an industry. This session will help you understand specific AI/ML security challenges and mitigations, with no expertise required. We\u2019ll begin with a quick introduction to the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence, then using real-life examples and demos explain these new security risks and the next steps required to defend against them. In closing we will discuss how Microsoft is leveraging its experience with Tay, Zo, and the Security Development Lifecycle to address these issues through new engineering investments, security guidance/automation, and customer engagement.\r\n",
