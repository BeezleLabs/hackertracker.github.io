While this approach may suffice in some cases, ask yourself the following questions: \"Will this scale? Will this detect current/future variants of the technique? Is this resilient to bypass?\" If your confidence level in answering these questions is not high, it's time to consider a more mature methodology for identifying detection data sources. With a little bit of reverse engineering, a defender can unlock a multitude of otherwise unknown telemetry.

COM hijacking allows an attacker to load a library into a calling COM-enabled process. It\ufffds a feature, not a bug. While it is commonly used for persistence, some famous COM hijacks have led to more severe exploits. COM hijacking is already used by several families of malware, and it\ufffds time that pentesters caught up on how to abuse this feature. This presentation will cover COM hijacking from start to finish; showing how discover hijackable COM objects, how to use them offensively, and how to make the calling process remain stable.

What can security teams do to shape user behavior to eliminate or at least mitigate these risks? Bring your best enterprise user awareness solutions as this all woman panel shares what works based on their professional experiences.
