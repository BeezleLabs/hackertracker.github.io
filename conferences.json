      "description": "DerbyCon 8.0\u2019s theme this year is \u201cEvolution\u201d. We picked evolution this year partially because of DerbyCon evolving (changing) and moving to a new venue but also (and primarily) because of the evolution of the information security industry and how it is always changing and our desire to try to make it better. Evolution to us, is simply and exactly how it is defined: the gradual development of something, especially from a simple to a more complex form. The information security space started from something simple, and is becoming more and more complex each and everyday. How we handle the complexities and tackle situations is all apart of how we grow as an industry, and DerbyCon is a place where anyone who is remotely interested or someone who is well established in information security can experience it.\r\n\r\nThe idea of DerbyCon started in a pizza shop in Louisville after a few of us thought how awesome it would be to create a conference in Louisville Kentucky. The 4th street live area was awesome and we had been to so many conferences that we felt we could make one where everyone was welcome. DerbyCon has and continues to be a conference put together and run by awesome people in the security industry and by its attendees. We believe that DerbyCon is a central location for everyone to come share their research \u2013 hang with friends \u2013 and meet new ones. We hope to see you this year",

The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-things are happening.\u201d\r\n\r\nBSidesNoVA inaugural event was hosted at Center for Innovative Technology in Herndon, VA on Saturday, February 25th, 2017. Our event is attended by industry professionals and students.0 Speakers cover topics ranging from the state of the cybersecurity industry to bleeding edge research on vulnerabilities, exploits, protection, and response. Featured keynotes, speakers and panels are on our website at http://www.bsidesnova.org/speakers/. In addition to the talks, multiple activities are organized from Capture-the-Flag to Wireless Hacking, Soldering and Lock-Picking villages. The conference usually concludes with a Happy Hour Event that is hosted by one of our Platinum sponsors, Altus Consulting.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re a 100% volunteer organized event, put on by and for the community, and we strive to keep information free.\r\n\r\nWe thank every individual who has and is contributing to this project! The Northern Virginia area has one of the strongest cybersecurity communities in the technology area.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to another successful event on the March 2nd, 2019!",
