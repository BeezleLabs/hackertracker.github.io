      "description": "In late 2018, a popular node.js package changed ownership. This package became the delivery mechanism for malicious code that traversed through multiple environments to inject its final payload into a mobile application. This exploit existed in the wild for 48 days and was downloaded over 8 million times before it was found. How was it found? What was its purpose and how did it happen in the first place?\r\n\r\nThis exploit is one example of a well-planned, sophisticated attack that targeted the most valuable and privileged computers in a company, development and build machines. In this session we will dive into how the attack happened, the three payloads, how they worked, how they were obfuscated, and what their goal ultimately was.\r\n\r\nThis is not node/npm specific and any public repository of source code is vulnerable. This is a growing risk that many companies are absorbing without fully understanding and, without better management, will inevitably lead to incredible exploits in the future.",

Since that time the program has evolved dramatically: courses have been continually revised to teach only industry-relevant skills, the college has hired new faculty to lead even more advanced and updated topics, and also worked with partners to begin offering meaningful internships for students. But the college still faces a problem: academia lives in a slio. As an institution, we realize that if we want to elevate our students learning to the next level, we need to develop stronger relationships with InfoSec professionals, and their organizations. This talk will directly outline how professionals can give back by acting as student mentors, sitting on our advisory committees, developing internships, teaching courses, as well as being willing to review courses to ensure the correct content is being taught.",

      "description": "Translation tables are a dynamic component of HDD firmware that translate logical addresses to physical locations on the disk. Corrupted translators can be the cause of drive failures in drives that appear undamaged and are without physical trauma. That failure can be reversed in many cases. We will present ways to identify if a drive\u2019s translator has been corrupted for the Moose & Pharaoh drive families specifically, how to force a translator rebuild, and open source tool(s) to help you repair the translator. Data recovery is a notoriously secretive field. Very little information about firmware and its internal data structures is public. By sharing what we\u2019ve learned we hope to open this field up to more people, encourage repair, encourage re-use rather than disposal of hard drives, and encourage further publicly shared research. After the talk, attendees should be able to fix this type of error themselves in HDDs of the appropriate families using a TTL converter and the supplied code. Familiarity with the basic components of hard drive firmware is helpful, but not required.",

Many of the techniques are used to liberate secret information from other processes or trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel\u2019s SGX, ARM\u2019s TrustZone, and the like. Some of the techniques making headlines are related to speculative execution properties of modern processors, but there is an entire class of non-speculative techniques also receiving a lot of attention in recent research. Luckily there are a few techniques available for implementing algorithms that use secrets\u2014like cryptography\u2014so they present as few opportunities for leaking information as possible. In this talk you will learn the anatomy of a few classic non-speculative side-channels on mathematical algorithms used in just about every system in modern computing, followed by industry best practices for mitigating them, and finally what you can do to help minimize the risks for your applications.",

      "description": "This workshop provides some helpful and lightweight tools/techniques for both new and experienced SOC analysts and incident responders to speed up their ability to understand and characterize a potential incident. It provides some context and examples about how and why these tools and techniques so consistently show up in SOC triage and analysis efforts.\r\n\r\nThere are many sophisticated and complex endpoint detection and response tools, sandboxes, and analysis tools which a SOC analyst or incident responder can use to identify and understand a potential incident. Many of these tools are complex and powerful, but sometimes it\u2019s the simple tools combined with specific host logging configuration options which can make a difference for SOC analysts and incident responders.\r\n\r\nThis workshop came from my recent realization that the most frequently used tools I was using while looking at incidents had something to do with de-obfuscation or decoding of powershell or other encoded scripts, and I was using CyberChef to do the vast majority of it. Given the prevalence of powershell and encoding in commodity malware campaigns, exploit kits, and in post-exploitation activity, it is likely that most incident responders will benefit from sharing experiences and techniques using these tools. Often, CyberChef and some key powershell logging options are enough to allow a responder to rapidly triage an event or alert to decide whether it\u2019s significant or not, which is why I felt there was value in sharing the techniques I was using.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop I\u2019ll describe why these tools/techniques are important to the detection/incident triage process, provide some examples of the key configurations/logs that are needed to maximize benefit, and provide (and then walk through) several technical decoding examples for the workshop attendees.

      "description": "Serialized data is neither new nor exciting. Serialization and deserialization have been in use by countless applications, services and frameworks for a long time. Many programming languages support serialization natively, and most people seem to understand it well. However, many of us don\u2019t fully understand security implications of data deserialization, and in the last couple of years this topic got an increasing focus in the security community, up to the point that insecure deserialization made it to the list of OWASP Top 10 most critical web application security risks! Needless to say high-severity vulnerabilities in some well-known applications as well as popular frameworks such as Apache Struts and Apache Commons Collections raised awareness of this risk.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we\u2019ll discuss how serialized data are used in software, talk about different serialization formats and the dangers of deserializing untrusted input. We will review some real life vulnerabilities and related exploits. The presentation will contain several code examples with live demos of bypassing security controls by exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities. We\u2019ll forge a session cookie, elevate privileges, cause a denial of service, and even perform a remote code execution - all via insecure deserialization! The demos will use native Java, Python and .NET serialization, as well as JSON and XML formats. Of course, we\u2019ll also talk about how to deserialize in secure way!\r\n\r\nNext time you develop your awesome web or mobile app or a microservice, keep in mind how a clever attacker could create and supply malicious data to your application, and thinking like a hacker you could write more secure code!",

The main toolsets for this portion of the lab are going to be Atomic Red Team, MITRE ATT&CK Adversary Emulation Plans, APT Simulator and LOLbins. Using these tools, we can select multiple techniques to abuse a victim machine in various ways. This is intended to be interactive and exciting for security professionals who are not exposed to the red-teaming side of security.\r\n\r\nAfter the abuse of each technique, we can look at the telemetry gathered by the endpoint. To make this resonate with all attendees, we will be using telemetry from Microsoft and their SysInternals tools, which will then be collected and visualized using the Elastic stack. Using the Elastic stack, we can dig into the telemetry and pivot around to understand the scope of an incident.\r\n\r\nAttendees will have the opportunity to see real-world use cases of \u201cmalware\u201d in action, as these are being pulled and linked back to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This will also demonstrate the power of collecting telemetry for the use of security analytics. We are going to be using free tools in the lab, but the data collected and visualized can reproduced by a number of vendors on hand at RSA each year. Attendees will be able to take this knowledge back to their organization and increase their security posture immediately.",

You will know the basics of fuzzing.\r\n2. You will know how to write custom network protocol fuzzers using state of the art open source tools.\r\n3. You will have hands on experience with this widely-discussed but still largely mysterious test method.\r\n\r\nBefore (Prerequisites): You should:\r\n\r\n1. Be comfortable doing some basic programming in Python.\r\n2. Understand basic network protocol concepts (e.g. what is a protocol and what is a network layer).\r\n3. Be familiar with WireShark and how to use it.\r\n4. Have a laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM (16 GB recommended).\r\n\r\nWhat you won\u2019t learn:\r\n\r\n1. Exploit development.\r\n2. Python programming. Because you can already do that (see above). ;)",

Giving up is no option, so let\u2019s bring the fight to attackers with deception, lies, and all other trickery we can come up with. Let\u2019s fool malware about the nature of the computer they\u2019re on, let\u2019s tempt malware with treasures that don\u2019t exist.\r\n\r\nThis talk introduces SNAPTRAP, a modular open-source framework for orchestrating these deceptions across endpoint workstations on a Windows network. SNAPTRAP allows administrators and power users to set traps on workstations and let incautious malware and attackers stumble in to them.\r\n\r\nWe are providing a complete functional system along with a simple SDK and documentation. We aim to create an open community of researchers to draw techniques from the hacker tool chest, turn them around, and plant seeds of doubt that maybe, just maybe, their target computer is lying to them.",

      "description": "Tor is among the most used networks for anonymous communication. This anonymity can be undermined via entry-exit and end-to-end attacks. Using Game Theory, we introduce and analyze the viability of several methods for reducing Tor\u2019s vulnerability to such attacks. Entry-exit attacks rely upon controlling entry and exit nodes within the Tor Network, while end-to-end attacks utilize Autonomous Systems. Because both types of attacks rely on chance, we consider the success probability maximizing strategies of adversaries. We analyze changes to Tor\u2019s routing strategy that decrease the success probability of such attacks. Our goal is to support anonymity preserving systems against large Autonomous Systems providers and attackers with access to large computing power. We build upon previous work by eliminating exit node bandwidth quotas within Tor and decreasing asymmetric routing to make compromising anonymity less likely. We show the probability that anonymity is preserved if one uses Tor for a year can be increased from ~62% to ~85% if our suggestions are implemented.",

However, my research has shown that these tools have shortcomings in usability and privacy preservation; none fulfill both key security and usability requirements.\r\n\r\nThis talk will begin with the philosophy of anonymity networks, their desired technical requirements, and a short introduction to a selection of existing networks, including my new project Onionr. Additionally, the talk will provide an overview of the major features to look for when picking an anonymous network to use. At the end, I will demonstrate how Onionr fulfills our requirements of a well-made anonymity network.
