I will share my realizations, failures, moments of nerd rage, and what's this? Is that a bit of success? My goal is to share my experience as I learned about Bluetooth vulnerabilities and how to use both hardware and software tools to exploit them. I will be going over things that I assumed were true/false about Bluetooth \"hacking\" and providing the real answers that I found along the way (almost myth buster \"ish)). Beginners will benefit from this because I started this journey as a beginner so all of the doubts, curiosity and frustrations are bundled into a neat little package that I hope will help others have an easier go at it. Anyone beyond beginner will benefit from this because I want to engage others in the Q&A session, including but not limited too suggestions on how I could have done things differently, tool recommendations and future project suggestions. Regardless of skill level I plan for this to be very informative and entertaining for everyone.",

This talk delves into tools that are freely available, and how they can be integrated to empower even the smallest of information security departments to effectively monitor, track, and investigate events to help lower risk and increase security posture within their organizations.

Due to the need for a 100% uptime of these critical infrastructures, monitoring of data in the ICS network has to be constant. IT OT convergence covers the ways we can integrate Information Technology and Operations Technology in order to meet the demands of modern-day standards of system, network and security monitoring & diagnostics to cloud systems. At the moment, the way that communications are being remote off network traffic is being handled is through a process referred to as \u201cair gapping\u201d in which the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition network (SCADA for short) on its own segmented network allows access to the internet for small periods of time. And these communications, updates etc, happen in an asynchronous manner. For true IT OT convergence to happen, the air-gap needs to be bridged, and the way that data comes in and out of the SCADA network needs to be very protected and handled in a scrutinous manner in all perimeter layers. However, what is happening right now is that these networks and devices are being exposed and placed RIGHT onto the open internet, where anyone can observe and sometimes interact with these systems and devices that constitute these systems. This presentation will cover ways that these systems are compromised, and some ways to \u201cTake home\u201d to secure the air-gap between IT and OT.",

In general, a question relevant both for blockchain developers and security researchers is: what is a set of \"baseline\" bugs that apply in that context. Of interest are bugs inherent to the blockchain; general appsec bugs such as memory corruption are less interesting, as they do not really pertain to the nature of blockchain systems. In this talk we'll briefly look at a possible list of such baseline bug classes and focus on application security level DoS vectors. This includes issues related to serialization/deserialization, orphan transaction handling, quadratic complexity processing on user supplied input, memory stores of unlimited size, etc. The goal of this talk is to equip the audience with the means to search for relevant application-level DoS bugs in popular coins themselves.",

That is what this presentation will entail: keys will be created using raw metal and fire. But not in a forge or foundry... this is a tactic that can be employed in the field by covert entry types who want a way to gain repeated access without having to carry around key blanks and specific tools specialized for every brand of lock.

Also known as the IBM Z family, it is *not* a legacy system; it's still actively maintained and updated, it's still the workhorse of industries from finance to airlines, and it still makes IBM billions of dollars every year. Unfortunately, a combination of proprietary software, high entry costs, and a less-than-cuddly user community has been effective at scaring away new mainframers for decades. It's also been effective at scaring CIOs and CISOs from ever letting infosec staff anywhere near them. This talk will break down mainframes and how they work in terms that a Windows or Linux power user can understand, show you some of the attacks they can be vulnerable to, and hopefully inspire you to go back to your organizations and clients and start testing mainframes!",

      "description": "The most widely used network-based data exfiltration techniques typically rely on the higher layers of the OSI model in IPv4 networks. The risk with using these higher protocol layers is that IDS/IPS signatures and SIEM rules can be written to spot protocol anomalies and thwart exfiltration. Enter IPv6. Designed to address the growing number of network-connected devices, IPv6 expands the IP space from 32 bits to 128 bits. Now, with more addresses than stars in the universe (~1x10e24), providers are issuing trillions of routable addresses to their customers. By utilizing the unused space that will inevitably exist in most IPv6 networks, paired with the expanded protocol header fields, low data rate exfiltration becomes possible using only Layer 3 protocol headers with the added bonus of a low risk of detection.",

      "description": "In 1905 Harry Houdini wrote his first book entitled \u201cThe Right Way to Do Wrong\u201d wherein he divulged the lockpicking and other trade secrets of criminals. People make assumptions about how schemes work and believe them to be complicated, yet in many cases the insider knows how simple they are. Most people assume that besides tailgating and social engineering, real break-ins (or physical security testing) are all about picking locks. However, the secret is that on physical pentests it\u2019s typically unnecessary to do that! Some physical controls have known bypasses, and some building contractors (or even locksmiths) don't implement things correctly. Just like Houdini, I\u2019ll be divulging the simple tricks of the trade employed by both criminals and professional physical pentesters to bypass physical controls without using lockpicks. You may be shocked and amazed by what you see, and once you leave you'll be an insider too - seeing insecurity everywhere!",

      "description": "During Red Team engagements it is important to be able to quickly deploy resources (c2 infrastructure, payloads, phishing pretexts, etc) that are independent of each other in order to reduce the chances of getting detected simply by the attribution of related infrastructure. This typically also requires the procurement of established (categorized) domains which can be difficult to obtain. On the other side of the fence, an Incident Response Team\u2019s activity can be fingerprinted by attackers due to the observable patterns and reuse of scripted analysis tools. This talk will demonstrate how addition of serverless cloud computing can solve the aforementioned problems, and add an immediate benefit to an Infosec Practitioners toolkit (both Red and Blue). Detailed examples will be provided (including source code) showing how serverless functions can be used to perform tasks like using nmap to scan a target, exploiting a SQLi vulnerability with sqlmap, automating malware analysis, and much more - all while avoiding the need to reuse (and maintain) long term infrastructure.",
