This entire system/project is open-sourced as part of the project as live streaming and recorded videos, so that developers can watch each of the lessons, add it to their own pipelines, and have a head start on DevSecOps.  The talk will consist mostly of a start-to-finish demo of the system, finishing with the DevSlop team releasing their own website live, on stage, using the pipeline. Tools showcased include SSL Labs, White Source Bolt and OWASP Zap.\n\nFor many people 'the cloud' and DevSecOps can be a bit mysterious.  Let's clear this up with a nice, long, slow demo of how to load up an app in your editor, make a change, run it through your pipeline (and pass the security checks!), then publish it into the cloud.

Anyone with access to the etcd cluster has access to all your Kubernetes secrets.\n\nThankfully there are better ways. This lecture provides an overview of different techniques for more securely managing secrets in Kubernetes including secrets encryption, KMS plugins, and tools like HashiCorp Vault.

      "description": "Getting application security right often requires that developers have a deeper than average understanding of the security domain. In what other industry is this the case? We don't have to be M.D.s to get a medical diagnosis; we don't have to be auto mechanics to get our cars fixed, yet we in security wag our fingers at \"iD10t errors\" and build grand mousetraps to catch \"so obvious\" developer missteps, when they may not know what they need to add, change or remove from their applications to make it \"secure\" in the first place. Furthermore, patterns to address these issues don't always fit the requirements of the application short or long term, resulting in solutions that only address part of the problem, or worse, are omitted altogether because they are too cumbersome to implement. \n\nMy answer to this is _spartan-a node application created for developers of node.js applications, not security people. _spartan allows developers to create security policies which address their node app's (whether it be Desktop, Web, Mobile, IoT or API) specific requirements; it installs & configures the modules to match the policy and; it generates the boilerplate code that developers can import directly into their applications.",

Even so, the risk of prosecution under anti-hacking laws still casts a cloud over the hackers who are trying to help, and many programs haven't removed this risk by including Safe Harbor language within their program policies. It's not intentional -- the simple truth is that the market has progressed so rapidly that most have implemented crowdsourced security programs without realizing this issue, nor do they know how to how to fix it. Bilateral Safe Harbor language enables program owners to not only provide a strong incentive for good-faith hackers in terms of explicit legal protection, but also to outline exactly what constitutes \"good-faith\" hacking for their organization, and leave legal protections against malicious hackers intact.\n \nThis talk provides an overview of Safe Harbor in the context of good-faith hacking and introduces a current effort to create a standardized, open-source, easily readable legal boilerplate for disclosure program owners all around the world to use.\n\nWhat is Safe Harbor and key takeaways from CFAA/DMCA\nWhy we need a open source vulnerability standardized disclosure\nWhat is disclose.io\nHow can companies participate\nHow can security researchers participate\nHow can legal community participate",

From threat modeling to triage, moms and dads have expertise that may not be recognized. We want to call that to attention and stress that providing a flexible workplace in order for the people with these diverse skills to thrive is a worthwhile investment.",

      "description": "With the increasing dependence on digital systems, cybersecurity is in high demand to secure resources, information, platforms, and identities throughout an organization's entire technical stack, including online and on-prem systems. Public awareness of the need for security and privacy is on the rise, but companies and government regulations are not keeping pace with the fast-changing threat ecosystem. The goal of this project is to enumerate and explore the concrete ways companies' security practices can be aligned with current best practices for consumer data protection. Drawing from expectations implied by U.S. state, federal and international law (such as the California Privacy Act, HIPAA and EUGDPR), industry standards and current understanding of effective IT security practice, the guideline developed in this research shows the actions that companies should follow in order to secure their customers' data and by extent achieve an ethical business practice as well as the grounds to be held accountable for their actions and mistakes. This is all focused from a business perspective: security is approached in terms of a \u2018calculated risk' and the acceptance of consequences instead of the traditional technical-only analysis, which is often incomprehensible to management.",

      "description": "Ever watched a news anchor present the latest vulnerability or fast-moving malware and wondered how that story went from research to headline? Who came up with the soundbites? Who tech reviewed the research before it hit the news? Why aren't there more details and POC code? And why isn't the original researcher on TV doing the talking? The behind the scenes reality is probably more complicated than you think and includes peer researcher reviews, responsible disclosure activity, legal edits (and wrangling), and keeping the PR and marketing machines tuned to technical truth. I learned all of this first-hand when tasked with building out a new research publication process for one of the world's largest security companies. After analyzing the problem, we developed an original, interconnected, \u201cgear-based\u201d framework for coordinating the process quickly using a collaborative, community approach. In this talk, I'll explain the many moving parts of research publication and detail the framework that I developed with my colleagues to ensure the research word got out as quickly, effectively, and responsibly as possible. I'll share what worked - and what didn't - and deliver practical advice on how to set up the process, deal with fast (latest malware) and slow (annual security report) research cycles, manage researcher expectations, handle issues with plagiarism, work with legal reviewers, and determine the best channels for amplifying the message and keeping the research publication gears turning smoothly.",

      "description": "One of the first and most important lessons the risk assessor learns is that the human is the weakest link. While computers will never stray from their algorithms, the average user is naive and forgetful - making them susceptible to being socially engineered into disclosing sensitive information.\n\nThe average user doesn't see themself as a piece of the security puzzle - they believe that their data is sufficiently protected by immature frameworks, ethical corporations, and academia or affairs that are \u201ctoo complicated\u201d for them to participate in. As infosec professionals we know this is far from the truth - the compromise of an entire infrastructure can be owed to even the smallest human error. Yet our average user is unaware of the risk they carry, leading them to believe that anything they are allowed to know or do is inherently secure rather than simply being convenient for business operations.\n\nHackers are Scary recounts how a quest to make privacy and security a priority in the healthcare sector reveals this gap between theoretical responsibility and actual practice. Through the trials and tribulations in making health record fraud and medical device vulnerabilities an approachable topic, one thing becomes clear: that the average user is actually quite concerned, but does not know how to participate. At the same time, industry culture has a tendency to pass off this this gap of knowledge as the user's laziness or irresponsiblity. Only by creating an approachable dialogue with which the non-security savvy can interface with will they be able to learn how they fit into the bigger picture - both technically and culturally - and why it is necessary for them to take agency over the protection of data entrusted to them.",

But what about negligence in following policy as a kind of insider threat?  Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a subset of Game Theory that analyzes and attempts to measure how much a system can be degraded by selfish behaviors.  \r\n\r\nThis talk is for everyone looking to crack the egg of cyber defense and stop the Whack-A-Intrusion game and asks how we can use Game Theory to create proactive solutions in the technical and psychological realm of cybersecurity.  We will discuss what Game Theory is, how it is being used today in Cybersecurity, and then attempt to apply a non-cyber principle (PoA) to further calculate if the changes we are making in cyber defense is actually helping us become more secure (or if it is just lip service).  This talk will NOT tell you the best AV to use.  The purpose is to show you a different way of thinking about defense decision making, down to the employee/policy level.",

      "description": "In the recent past, we have seen various well-known organizations encountered AWS S3 bucket data leak exposing millions of customer records and confidential corporate information. Hackers enumerate and try to find out publicly accessible S3 buckets because it's like public share with juicy information. In most of the cases, it was seen that excessive permissions and misconfiguration were the main reasons for data exposure. In the run to get the most benefit of cloud, security considerations are avoided or ignored leaving S3 bucket exposed. Though Organizations are working hard to secure data in the cloud more efforts are required to put in place to make sure people, process and technology work hand in hand to protect data in the cloud.\r\nIn this talk, the audience will learn to enumerate public S3 buckets, gain access to them through open sources tools. Further, they will be demonstrated to exploit READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, WRITE_ACP or FULL permissions on buckets/objects to download sensitive information or upload unintended content. Following, the AWS security tools, services and features will be recommended to secure and restrict S3 buckets. The emphasis is on customer responsibilities, so that they understand importance of their role in securing S3 and circumvent misconfigurations.",

Medical devices are being fitted with \ufffdsmart\ufffd technology in order to better serve patients and stay at the forefront of health technology. However, medical devices that enable connectivity, like all other computer systems, incorporate software that is vulnerable to threats.\r\n\r\nMedical device recalls increased 126% in the first quarter of 2018, mostly due to software issues and vulnerabilities. Abbott and Bayer, among other medical device companies, had recalls on devices based on weaknesses discovered by both government security entities and academic institutions. These devices, which included pacemakers, infusion pumps, and MRI machines, were found to have vulnerabilities ranging from buffer overflow bugs to the presence of hard-coded credentials that easily lent to unauthorized access of proprietary information.\r\n\r\nA breach of any one of these devices could compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as patient safety. In order to mitigate these types of vulnerabilities, the FDA has issued a guidance, as well as a vulnerability scoring system, in order to assess impact. This system assesses the attack vector, the complexity, risk and severity of both patient harm and information compromise, and the remediation level. By utilizing a more rigid system along these guidelines, there is hope that the threat of a medical device attack will be diminished.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore some of the past and current vulnerabilities facing the medical device industry, and the steps that the FDA is taking to mitigate these risks.",

This started with the only things I could control: breath and my tongue against my teeth. I held faith that any logical networking would provide a workable outcome. What transpired turned into something that approximately 1% of 1% do: survive, and then thrive, beyond damage to the deepest, most challenging CPU known to man.

      "description": "What happens when you are tired of your current InfoSec role, experience an unexpected layoff or if you would like to move on or up in your career? Instead of waiting to land a new job to learn new skills you can already be getting a head start on being the perfect candidate for your next role! This talk will discuss self-learning and taking the initiative to learn new skills on your own time for free or at a discounted price. I want to encourage others not to wait for their employer, university or a Bootcamp to get new skills. I will be providing resources and strategies that can be used to advance in your InfoSec career. Key factors to advancing in your InfoSec career include Never stop learning, your future job title, networking, and investing in yourself. After this talk, you will gain the confidence and the resources to prepare for your next InfoSec role.",

      "description": "Almost every interview has a version of the request, \u201cTell Me About Yourself.\u201d People often have trouble articulating their journey and how it has made them a great employee. After my recent experiences having to answer it myself innumerable times as well as mentoring others at all career levels, I have developed tips for turning vague stories into a polished pitch. As a software engineer who went to art school, it's critical that I articulate my skills clearly before I am dismissed by technical recruiters. This workshop starts with a presentation, but then quickly becomes interactive. I start with a warm-up question, then ask for a volunteer to tell their story. I give direct feedback which helps everyone absorb the main points by connecting it with the live example.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaways are:\r\nEveryone is better than they were before. At every job you were in, you learned something, even if technically you moved laterally or even down. \r\nIf you worked as a barista, you learned customer service, multi-tasking and problem solving. \r\nYour skills are more important than how you used them.\r\nInstead of focusing on the task (e.g. folding clothes at a retail store), turn it into the skill (in that example, attention to detail and quality control). \r\nRemember that you are interviewing them as well. If a manager cannot appreciate your diverse skills, find the one who can.",

      "description": "Women have made great strides since we entered the workforce.  We have a foot firmly in the door, and are scrambling for seats at the table. Now that we are in the system, it's painfully obvious that the rules weren't written with our requirements in mind and the code is woefully outdated. \r\n\r\nHow do we adapt the mad skills we developed to break into a male dominated industry, to find our niche and encourage more women to join the ranks?  Are we going to settle for minor bug fixes and a superficial graphics refresh, or are we going to work together to rewrite the operating system?  \r\n\r\nWe may not be able to accomplish everything at once but we can do something at once. We can start by re-programing ourselves, open-sourcing that code, and building a self-healing network and an operating system that is resilient enough to support our growing community.  Let's get started now!",

      "description": "Empathy as a security tool has been trending lately, mostly regarding attackers. But what does it look like to be  empathetic to our users? Toward developers? Toward those who make the bugs, cut the corners, reuse their passwords and decline 2FA? And where do you even start?\r\n\r\nI will make the case that empathetic security design and communication will:\r\n- increase take-up of security behaviors by users and developers\r\n- improve your ability, as a security professional, to communicate security concepts to developers, decision-makers, designers and users, and\r\n- help you design better tools and tips for users.\r\n\r\nThe core of the talk will focus on understanding users and developers. I will give three key concepts to guide you toward empathy, and I will present some entertaining and enlightening research on the beliefs, feelings and threat models that inform user behavior, and answer the question \"why won't users just get password managers already?\" (It's probably not what you think!)\r\n\r\nTo finish, I will give you some practical techniques for teasing out the reasons behind the reasons why your target audience, be they users, developers, or others, act the way they do, and tools for turning those reasons into incentives for better behavior and mutually agreeable outcomes.",

      "description": "Chances are, you're frustrated that your ideas, solutions, and advice just don't seem to get through to the decision-makers you work with. This happens to everyone from time to time, but if it's a regular occurrence for you, you might need to learn to increase your influence at work.\r\n\r\nInfluence is the difference between that person at work whose team always seems to get extra staffing, or that developer who always gets to choose the tech, and those that don't. \r\n\r\nIt isn't magic, it isn't luck, and it isn't _just_ natural ability. You can learn how to increase your influence through some simple planning, framing and delivery steps.\r\n\r\nThese skills are important if you want to make sure your expert opinion is understood and considered by those making crucial decisions about budgets, time frames, architecture, security and even everyday things like the air-conditioning temperature.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive workshop I will explain the basics of influence in a workplace, talk you through the steps, and walk you through addressing a real problem in your real workplace.",
