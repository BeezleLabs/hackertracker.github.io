Our goal has always been to become a place where the Chicago hacking scene could get together, let loose, focus, and cultivate the next generation of hackers. This includes keeping the con familiar and high quality, which is why we max out attendance at 1500 people. We brought you back to our formidable venue with tasty nibbles and sips from the food tent, epic talks, and new villages. Somewhere in the venue is some unique artwork, go check it out. If you have the desire to be a GOLD lifetime badge holder, earn it by winning one of the contests. Good Luck. We love it when a plan comes together. \r\n\r\n~The THOTCON A-Team\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy and pass the good word on twitter or other social media under #THOTCON. \r\n\r\nWe would not be here without you and your recommendations, so if you have anything you want more/less of, please let us know at feedback@thotcon.org."
