      "description": "Honeypots can be implemented to discover new threat information or detect intruders on a network. However, while there are numerous free honeypots available, many of them can be complicated to deploy or require additional engineering around them to consume log data. Are you curious to learn more about honeypots? Are you interested in deploying your own honeypots on the Internet? HoneyDB is comprised of a honeypot agent and data collection backend, which makes getting started with honeypots simple. In the HoneyDB honeypot workshop, you will learn about honeypots, configure and deploy a honeydb-agent in the cloud, and use HoneyDB tools to query honeypot data. This workshop is for beginner levels and up. See the latest details about this workshop at https://riskdiscovery.com/honeydb/workshop",

      "description": "Container and serverless technology have changed the way applications are developed and the way deployments are done. Organizations, both large and small have openly embraced containerization to supplement traditional deployment paradigms like Virtual Machines and Hypervisors.Containers have risen in popularity and have been widely used because they help package and deploy consistent-state applications across multiple environments, and are also extremely scalable especially when they are complemented with orchestration technologies.Serverless, on the other hand, seems to be taking over at a rapid rate with increased usage of micro-services and polyglot development of applications and services across organizations.However, security remains a key challenge that both Organizations and security practitioners face with containerized and serverless deployments. While containers continue to be vulnerable to security threats that plague any typical application deployment, they also face specific security threats related to the containerization daemon, the shared kernel and other shared resources like network, process and the filesystem. Serverless deployments face risks such as insecure deployment configurations, inadequate monitoring, and logging of functions, broken authentication, function event data injection, insecure secret storage, and many more.Attacking services and applications leveraging container and serverless technology requires a specific skill set and a deep understanding of their underlying architecture.This training has been created with the objective of understanding both offensive and defensive security for container orchestrated and serverless deployments. It will be a 2-day program that will detail through specific theory elements with extensive hands-on exercises that are similar to real-world threat scenarios that the attendees will understand and take part in and will also understand the ways in which containerized and serverless deployments can be attacked, made secure, yet scalable, efficient and effective.The training consists of, but not limited to the following focus areas in Container Security and Serverless Deployment: Introduction to Container TechnologyContainerized Deployments and Container Orchestration TechnologiesContainer Threat-ModelAttacking Containers and Security deep-diveIntroduction to KubernetesThreat-Model of Orchestration technologiesAttacking KubernetesKubernetes Defense-in-DepthLogging & Monitoring Orchestrated deploymentsIntroduction to ServerlessDeploying Application to AWS LambdaServerless Threat-Model Attacking a Serverless Stack Serverless Security Deep-dive",

Frontend JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React have changed the way we build web applications. However, did you know that these frameworks also disrupt the security landscape? For example, Angular and React change the nature of XSS as we know it. They also conflict with modern security measures, such as Content Security Policy.In this training, you will learn how to build secure Single Page Applications. We cover changes in the security model of an application, common threats to an application, framework features that increase security, and state-of-the-art security technology you should start using. Concretely, we will cover the following topics:XSS in Angular and ReactAdvanced injection attacks The limitations of CSP in Single Page Applications Recent developments in CSPProtecting yourself against malicious third-party contentJWT abuse and best practicesThe intricacies of Cross-Origin Resource SharingRecent developments in using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID ConnectThe training consists of both lectures and hands-on lab sessions. Lectures go into depth on security threats and mitigation strategies. Labs are conducted in a custom-built competitive lab environment. Security challenges give you hands-on experience with attacks and defenses. You will walk away from this training with an overview of current best practices, along with actionable advice on implementing them.",

Experience a practitioner's guide for how to take the most famous OWASP projects and meld them together into a working program. Projects are broken down into awareness/process/tools, with an explanation of the human resources required to make this successful.This course is a one-day training where there is a mixture of a lecture on a specific segment of OWASP projects, and then a practical exercise for how to use that project as a component of an application security program.The first group of projects is \"training/education\". These projects focus on high-level knowledge, methodology, and training for the application security program. This group includes OWASP Top 10, OWASP Proactive Controls, cheat sheets, and training apps (Juice Shop, DevSlop, and WebGoat). Discussions focus on the process of raising awareness with knowledge/training and building out a program. The practical portion includes discussion of rolling out proactive controls and hands-on time with JuiceShop.The second group is \"process/measurement\". These focus on requirements, code review, best practices, development libraries, and building software without known vulnerabilities. This group includes ASVS, SAMM, threat modeling, Code Review guide, and the testing guide. The end-to-end world of the developer is explored, from requirements through writing code. The working portion includes using ASVS to assess a sample app, threat modeling a sample app, and using SAMM for a sample assessment.The third group is \"tools\". This group focuses on tools, including the testing guide, Dependency-Check, Threat Dragon, CRS, and ZAP. The testing approach and touchpoints are discussed, as well as a high-level survey of the tools. The working portion includes using ZAP to scan a sample application.All of these tools work together to form the basis of an application security program with a budget of $0 except for the people resources to implement. This class teaches the projects to use as well as how to use them, with practical, hands-on experience.Audience: The audience for this session is two-fold. The first group is those that are interested in building an application security program using the various tools and documents available from OWASP. The second group is those that want to experience multiple OWASP tools and materials and use them in practical exercises.Prerequisites: Participants should have a foundational understanding of application/product security.Computer Setup: Bring a computer for executing the lab exercises. Participants should download the OWASP Proactive Controls, ASVS, SAMM, and ZAP.",

      "description": "Security today is customarily a reactive and chaotic exercise.Modern systems pose a number of thorny challenges and securing the transformation from legacy monolithic systems to distributed systems demands a change in mindset and engineering toolkit. The security engineering toolkit is unfortunately out-of-style and outdated with today's approach to building, security and operating distributed systems. Distributed systems at scale have unpredictable and complex outcomes that are costly when security incidents occur. The speed, scale, and complex operations within microservice architectures make them tremendously difficult for humans to mentally model their behavior.What if you could flip a security incident scenario on its head and drive it in reverse? Chaos Engineering allows for security teams to proactively experiment on recurring incident patterns to derive new information about underlying factors that were previously unknown by reversing the postmortem and preparation phase. This is done by developing live-fire exercises that can be measured, managed, and automated. Contrary to Red/Purple Team game days, chaos engineering does not use threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures. It develops teams by building a learning culture around system failure to challenge engineering teams to discover new insights on how they can improve their applied security.People operate differently when they expect things to fail. Additionally, teams are more likely to keep an open mind about what is actually causing those things to fail when they are not fighting fires. There is a fundamental shift in mental focus and operational momentum that drives teams to put the fire out versus thorough examination of what caused the incident to begin with. As far as we know it Chaos Engineering is the only proactive mechanism for detecting availability and security incidents before they happen. Security Chaos Engineering allows teams to proactively, safely discover system weakness before they disrupt business outcomes.In this session, we will introduce a new concept known as Security Chaos Engineering and how it can be applied to create highly secure, performant, and resilient distributed systems.",

      "description": "WordPress is a highly popular content management system used by over 33% of all websites on the internet. It\u2019s ease of use, great compatibility with a variety of servers and its huge list of free and powerful plugins (over 50.000) make WordPress the first choice for quickly and easily setting up a website without any technical knowledge or excessive budget. WordPress can be customized and optimized to a point that even governments and billion-dollar corporations use this blogging CMS to manage their websites. From america.gov to the swedish government, and from Microsoft to Facebook: they all use WordPress.The popularity of this and other CMS makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals seeking to take over as many websites as possible, as well as for nation states and other sophisticated hacking groups interested in backdooring high value targets. We observed that the high interest in WordPress\u2019 security by different groups lead to many vulnerabilities being discovered and patched in the past. Additionally, bug bounty programs and 0day acquisition platforms attract a vast amount of bounty hunters that slowly but surely squeezed easy to find vulnerabilities out of the WordPress core. Hence, the well-reviewed code of the most popular web application is a great challenge but also a good candidate to experiment with different approaches of code auditing.When we started our vulnerability research on the WordPress core code, we quickly realized that in order to find critical vulnerabilities one must move away from the traditional paradigm of how to find simple vulnerabilities in web applications and come up with more effective approaches and methodologies to source code auditing. This paper documents our approach of separating source code into components and combining several low-impact bugs into powerful Privilege Escalation and Remote Code Execution exploits. We believe that our documentation of vulnerability discovery does not only help other researchers to manifest their audit methodology but also helps developers to better understand the mindset of attackers. As a result, we found and combined five vulnerabilities into a powerful exploit chain that in the end allowed unauthenticated attackers to take over any high value target running WordPress.",

      "description": "Giving organizations a proactive, situational procedure to validate their insider threat program reduces gaps in coverage, limits tool or service misconfigurations, helps prevent system and model oversights, and provides real world practice scenarios. Over the last decade, there has been an influx of tools, task forces, and end-to-end solutions created to supplement insider threat programs. \"An effective insider threat program incorporates a number of technical controls to assist with preventing, detecting, and responding to concerning behaviors and activity\" (Spooner et al, 2018). In that same white paper, the authors also indicate that organizations, at a minimum, should adopt tools from each of the following categories: user activity monitoring (UAM), data loss prevention (DLP), security information and event management (SIEM), analytics, and digital forensics. The breadth of functionality and wide array of available tools, pose a challenge to organizations looking to build or strengthen their insider threat program. Furthermore, the panacea for all insider threats does not exist and methods must be adopted that are specific to organizational assets. This presentation builds on a review of the existing insider threat tool landscape and introduces a methodology to validate configurations and coverage through a situational insider threat assessment. Insider threat kill chains, how to simulate relevant risks, and quantifying key asset identification will also be covered.",

      "description": "This talk will be a walkthrough of how I built a detection engine focused on finding cryptocoin miners within an AWS architecture. It utilizes AWS Flow Logs as the data source and multiple statistical analysis techniques for both massaging the data and performing the actual detection. AWS Flow Logs do not function as traditional per-packet 5-tuple captures. Instead, the data is aggregated over a 10-minute period, organized by unique IP address and port numbers. This presents a unique challenge for building a detection model as you don't have detailed per-packet logs. The methodology itself follows an iterative design: look for a pattern, implement into code, check for false positives. This is repeated until we have a sufficiently knowledgable model capable of flagging cryptocoin mining traffic with a minimal false positive rate. The techniques discussed include cluster analysis via k-means and DBSCAN, convex hulls, linear regression analysis, nearest neighbor, and several other simple but very powerful statistical analysis techniques. The final implementation will be built on top of ELK, culminating into a turn-key release that owners can drop into their environments.",

      "description": "The Web application development lifecycle has numerous security activities. For developers, code review is a familiar recurring activity. To support Java developers, a project was started in 2012 called, \"Find Security Bugs\" (FSB). It is an extension of the SpotBugs project, formerly known as, FindBugs. FSB is a community static analysis tool which targets specific vulnerabilities. Over the years FSB has evolved from a limited tool to a solid coverage of bug patterns. It is now used in many large corporations to support automation. In this presentation, you will learn about its high-level internals and heuristics, its potential integration in developers' IDE and in continuous integration environments. A selection of vulnerabilities found by the tool in popular applications including Spring and Struts will be explained. For each of these vulnerabilities, we will review the description of the affected component, the issue reported by the tool, the method to analyze the report and an overview of the potential risks. Along the way you will learn a few tips on increasing your efficiency with the tool. After observing some real-world vulnerabilities, we will conclude with lessons learned from maintaining this open-source project for close to 8 years. Lessons learned will include some of the successes but also failures from the development initiatives.",

      "description": "With software security blunders making headlines and businesses under increasing pressure to deliver software faster, development and security teams have been tasked to devise a strategy to satisfy demands for more secure software and more rapid application development. These combining forces have led to the emergence of DevSecOps, which represents a shift in IT culture to accommodate the growing need for both security and speed. However, security teams want to shift left, development teams want to shift right, and Ops team want testing throughout all phases of the development cycle\u2014in other words, continuous testing. This leaves us with a lot of options and little guidance. What\u2019s the best approach? This talk will examine how your organization can inject security testing at the right time, at the right depth, by using the right tools, by defining the right processes, and with the right people. In this way, you can achieve continuous testing rather than testing without a clear strategy in place.",

      "description": "In very mature Agile organizations, application security teams focus on adding automated validation and testing points into their DevOps pipelines aka DevSecOps (or SecDevOps) to enforce the release of secure code. While it can feel like a \"work in progress,\" it's still a huge improvement over the typical manual \u201cgates\u201d that block rapid deployment. However, this is only one part of the effort. In Agile Product Security, the goal is to \u201cshift left,\u201d which means moving validation to earlier parts of the development process. But how does a team accomplish this? By partnering with development teams and acting as a product manager for \"Security as a Feature,\" teams can embed themselves into the ALM. Treating security as a set of required user features is far more effective than the typical tactic of adding non-functional requirements into a product backlog. It empowers security teams by adding real value to the business portfolio, thereby transforming them from the organization naysayers into heroes.",

      "description": "Hackers took three days to identify and exploit a known vulnerability in Equifax's web applications. More importantly. Equifax was not alone. Hackers quickly attempted to exploit the Struts vulnerability elsewhere. According to David Hogue, a senior technical director for the NSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Threat Operations Center (NCTOC), \"We had a nation-state actor within 24 hours scanning for unpatched [Struts] servers within the DoD.\" Other breaches were recorded at Alaska Airlines, the Canada Revenue Agency, Okinawa Power, the Japanese Post, the India Post, AADHAAR (India\u2019s social security system), and the GMO Payment Gateway, to name a few. The time required for hackers to exploit a newly disclosed open source vulnerability has shrunk by 93.5% in the last decade. This harsh reality establishes a new normal for software supply chain management and demands that organizations are prepared to do three things within 48 hours of a new public disclosure: * Assess which, if any, of their production applications are exploitable * Establish a comprehensive plan to remediate potential exposure, * Implement necessary fixes in production This session will highlight new data that reveals why three days (at most) is the new normal for DevSecOps teams to move new business /security requirements from design into production. It will also further enlighten DevOps teams, security and development professionals by sharing results from the 5th annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report -- a blend of public and proprietary data with expert research and analysis. Attendees can join this session to better understand how development and AppSec teams are applying lessons from W. Edwards Deming (circa 1982), Malcolm Goldrath (circa 1984) and Gene Kim (circa 2013) to improve their ability to respond to new business requirements and cyber risks.",

      "description": "Highly sensitive databases require enhanced technical measures to protect the confidentiality of their workloads. Typical controls in our application toolkit for these scenarios include implementing well-defined, mature authentication & authorization, and strong network (data-in-transit) & storage (data-at-rest) encryption paired with modern key management practices. Some systems further offer database-specific encryption mechanisms which work at the physical datafile level (and even the column- or row- level in a relational database) on top of any underlying OS full-disk or whole volume encryption. But fundamentally, these are server-side encryption models where the threat is physical media breach, backup leaks, or possibly protection from certain classes of operating system attacks; the assumption is that the database administrator, root user, or system level processes running on the machine are fully entrusted to access plaintext data and their associated keys.This session will take a deep dive into the threat models, designs and recent developments in client-side (data-in-use) encryption, including lessons learned from recent work bringing native client-side query integration into the most widely deployed open source NoSQL database in the world. We will discuss the security guarantees, confidentiality/performance trade-offs, and limitations among different types of authenticated encrypted search. Reference query design patterns will be presented, with example code demonstrating strong end-to-end encryption on public cloud or in on-premise datacenters.",

      "description": "As software becomes increasingly complex, its attack surface expands enabling the exploitation of a wide range of vulnerabilities. Web applications are no exception since modern HTML5 standards and the ever-increasing capabilities of JavaScript are utilized to build rich web applications, often subsuming the need for traditional desktop applications One possible way of handling this increased complexity is through the process of software debloating, i.e., the removal not only of dead code but also of code corresponding to features that a specific set of users do not require. Even though debloating has been successfully applied on operating systems, libraries, and compiled programs, its applicability on web applications has not yet been investigated. In this project, we present the first analysis of the security benefits of debloating web applications. We focus on four popular PHP applications and we dynamically exercise them to obtain information about the server-side code that executes as a result of client-side requests. We evaluate two different debloating strategies (file-level debloating and function-level debloating) and we show that we can produce functional web applications that are 46% smaller than their original versions and exhibit half their original cyclomatic complexity. Moreover, our results show that the process of debloating removes code associated with tens of historical vulnerabilities and further shrinks a web application\u2019s attack surface by removing unnecessary external packages and abusable PHP gadgets.",

Both well-known and small-medium businesses were attacked, conservatively yielding tens of millions of dollars to bad actors last year.\u201d - Symantec 2019 Internet Security Threat Report There are several ways to distribute Formjacking scripts, from browser add-ons to malware on the machine; but the most popular way is compromising the site's 3rd party JS and using them to hitchhike to all of their clients. Because 3rd party scripts are loaded directly into the browser from remote servers, they are out of bounds for traditional security solutions like Firewalls, WAF\u2019s and such. They are also tough to monitor, as their behavior may change from user to user, making their actions very hard to analyze. However; these scripts share the same level of access to a webpage as the website\u2019s internal scripts. Every script on the page, can have access to every field, manipulate the content of the page and even record keystrokes. Millions of users were affected by this attack in the past year alone, being the favorite tactic of the Magecart groups (named so for targeting Magento based sites) and many high profile hacks, from Delta Airlines to British Airways, Ticketmaster and more. The recent rise in Formjacking attacks created much noise, pointing to multiple technologies to try and close this gap; from CSP and SRI to proxying JS to control JS actions on the page and real-time sandboxing. These said with such passion that none are discussing the drawbacks of each approach. In my presentation, I cover all approaches, show real-time demos of Formjacking code, how the advocated methods can block it, and if and how can these be easily circumvented.",

The last of them were discovered and eradicated some time ago and the world is now living in an era of prosperity while the Auth Federation enjoys peaceful CVE-free times. However, while things seem to be running smoothly, new bugs are brewing at the core of major implementation libraries. This is probably the last chance for the evil empire to launch a world scale attack against the Auth Federation. In this talk, we will present two new techniques: 1) A new breed of SAML implementation flaws that break XML signature validation and enable arbitrary modification of the SAML assertion, which enables attackers to authenticate as arbitrary users or grant themselves arbitrary authorization claims. Although any implementation may be affected by this flaw, we will show how it affects Microsoft Windows Identity Framework (WIF) applications, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) web services, and flagship products such as SharePoint and Exchange Servers. 2) A bug in the .NET crypto library, which may allow attackers to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the availability of code gadgets in the target server.",

Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re entirely absolved of all security duties. Serverless functions still execute code and can still be vulnerable to application-level attacks. As a new type of architecture, serverless presents new security challenges. Some are equal to traditional application development, but some take a new form. Attackers are thinking differently, and developers must do so as well to gain the upper hand. In this talk, I will dive into the Top 10 risks of the OWASP Serverless Top 10 project. I will discuss why these risks are different from traditional attacks and how we should protect our application against them. I will also introduce OWASP DVSA, a deliberately vulnerable tool, aiming to assist both security professionals and developers to better understand the implications and processes of serverless security.",

      "description": "Encryption keys and passwords are truly \"keys to the kingdom.\" Acquiring them allows attackers to open all kinds of doors, and yet developers are often careless about how they handle them. We often see passwords and keys hard coded in the application source, stored with minimal obfuscation in configuration files, and in plaintext in databases. As a result, they fall victim to reverse engineering and software vulnerabilities such as Path Traversal, XXE, Local File Inclusion, and others. To help illustrate these risks we review the most common methods of storing credentials in an application, and discuss best practices for storing them, such as using keystores. Once your secrets are properly secured, however, there is an important remaining issue -- how do you secure the Master Key? The security of this \u201ckey that secures other keys\" (often referred to as the Key Encrypting Key or KEK) is critical to the security of the system. Would it not be vulnerable to the same issues we just tried to solve with keys and passwords? In our presentation we discuss preferred ways for securely storing KEKs, from hardware to software, and their relative costs. We propose several low cost ways for storing KEKs that any application can afford to implement, including what we believe is a novel approach that is resistant to remote attacks up to and including path traversal vulnerabilities where the attacker can obtain the contents of all relevant files. We then conclude by offering our open source library that helps to achieve that.",

But, when things go wrong\u2013and we know they will\u2013are we going to be successful with the DevSecOps model, or will we be left searching yet again?In an attempt to answer this question, we will look back in time over 120 years to unveil a tale that touches on business, engineering, and resilience. We will see how engineering decisions affect the lives of those around us and even though the world has radically changed over the last century, we are still facing many of the same root challenges.Along the way, we will highlight the high-performing DevSecOps teams of today and introduce a framework for approaching DevSecOps in your organization. Topics range from empathy to lean to system safety with the hope to frame a new playbook for devs, ops, and security to work together.",

In a brief study we conducted on 100 most visited websites, over 95% supported authenticated sessions with more than 97% of these are username and password based. 81% of discovered breaches are due to broken authentication, indicate there is still a problem to solve and this is the focus of our talk.Developers are generally aware of different authentication methods used for secure interaction between these entities, but most often miss out on best practices. In this context, we discuss popular authentication schemes like SAML, OAuth, token, magic links, adopted by developers today and emerging ones like WebAuthN. We will present incorrectly coded authentication patterns observed from our study and also highlight recurring mistakes like MFA bypass, token leakages and other authentication misconfigurations. Finally, we provide secure blueprints that developers can leverage to bake security into their software development lifecycle.",

      "description": "Threat Modeling is a great way to identify security risk by structuring possible attacks, bad actors and security controls over a broad view of the targeted system. Most people do threat modeling by documenting risk textually but visual representations can be powerful. This talk will show listeners how to build flow diagrams to analyze system risk using graphical tools. We\u2019ll explore flow diagram components and how to graph them using a whiteboard and vector graphics software. We\u2019ll also see how to create the diagrams as code using Python with the open source tool pytm. Putting your threat model in code allows you to refactor the model easily. It also gives you the freedom to generate multiple type of views from the same input and reuse parts of the model easily. While serving as an introduction, this presentation also gives away a few tricks to make threat modeling handy in the real world. With flow diagrams, having a clear one pager with information at a glance offer some advantages over other detailed methods. For example, adding a simple security controls table on the same page can be used as a way of communicating requirements to development teams. Modeling concepts will be demonstrated using different examples that are part of an OWASP Project collecting open sourced diagrams.",

Companies are leveraging Salesforce in many ways, adding even more sensitive customer data to the platform. While Salesforce is very secure, it\u2019s still a platform that can be implemented in a way that puts your org at risk. So how do you know Salesforce is implemented in a way that meets your compliance needs? And how do you actually align your Salesforce implementation to your Security Posture? It all starts with Data Governance, the foundation for Salesforce security. Data Governance provides the ability to effectively manage data using appropriate controls throughout the information lifecycle process to meet various internal and external requirements. We\u2019ll explain the basics and then dive into the more complex topics on how Salesforce, the lifecycle of customer data, and regulatory compliance can all effectively co-exist. We will explain the capabilities available to implement the 4 pillars of Data Governance (Data Inventory, Data Security, Data Privacy and Data Compliance). You\u2019ll walk away with tangible next steps for governing Salesforce, like data classification, access management, encryption at rest, user access management, compliance reporting and more.

In a smart home, we could pick a number such as 40 devices, and that sufficiently illustrates the point. But in many other scenarios, the number of devices is significant. Importantly, IoT security architects must realize also that the IoT system and its security mechanisms are often built for users who are largely uninterested in the engineering or security specifics of the system. They just expect it to work. As such, IoT systems do not only need to have secure defaults, but their security mechanisms shouldn\u2019t hinder reasonable use of the system.

      "description": "As we embrace DevOps to optimize our Agility, we start pushing working code toward production releases more frequently. Gone are the days where we can have a disjoint, mysterious security team that works down the hall or on some other floor. Whether we are doing true \"Continuous Deployment\" straight to production or not, we no longer have time for slow, manual, late-lifecycle security assessments to determine if our code is going to put us on the front page of the newspaper (for the wrong reasons). What we need is a way to know that our code is secure enough to pass muster every day. What we need is confidence that our software can continue to defend itself. What we need is continuous security.The DevSecOps movement is about exactly that: shifting security assessment left and integrating it into the daily and sprint-ly cycles that DevOps has made popular. It means finding those touchpoints in our continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline where security tools can be inserted and run continuously against the software changes as they are made. It means using static code analysis, dynamic security testing, secure composition analysis of third party components, and platform vulnerability scanning to look at all aspects of security every day. It means breaking builds and rejecting changes when developers introduce new security vulnerabilities.In this talk, I present my successes and challenges with integrating security into DevOps pipelines to provide continuous assessment of security posture. I focus on my latest experiences building delivery pipelines for a containerized microservice-based project where we integrated a broad set of open source and commercial tools to gather and present security data.",

Simultaneously, the average security team is too overloaded to help guide the daily needs of those very same teams.While this operational gap can be large, it does not need to be accepted as truth, and by using OWASP ZAP and its handy scripting engines we will explore the ways in which we can use such an application as a testing tool for development teams in a way that both enhances the quality of assertions in the current QA arsenal for exploratory, functional, regression, integration and automated test process. By so doing, it will also provide a natural springboard from which to incorporate security concerns, concepts, and education.",

      "description": "Vulnerabilities and attacks are like tsunamis caused by earthquakes that hit without warning, causing high damage and leave us scrambling. Although one cannot predict earthquakes, there are two Tsunami warning systems operated by NOAA in United States which produce reliable results in the nick of time. Based on the same core concepts and principles we have built an open source Vulnerability Warning Center that alerts on highly seismic vulnerabilities before they hit your organization shore. In this session we will demonstrate how a real time vulnerability alerting system can be built in AWS cloud using public data. With more than 2000 unique vulnerabilities disclosed every month CSOs and security practitioners have an impossible task of cutting through the noise and prioritize the most critical issues for remediation. And doing this daily is excruciating and weekly is too slow. Won't it be nice if there was an automated system that alerted on the most gruesome high-profile vulnerabilities in real time to produce actionable insights? Unlike getting data from honeypots and sensors, we decided to take a different approach to harnessed public data on attacks, exploits, data leaks, vulnerabilities, blogs, twitter and numerous other data points to create simple alerts and graphs that warn on actionable insights in real time. The system in this initial phase itself has shown remarkable results which we will demonstrate to the audience. In the live demo we will ask the audience to pick a day or week or month and demonstrate the system's capability to identify the most pressing security vulnerabilities during that timeframe. We will examine the design and implementation details to show how the system can the noise and rank the most relevant real-time vulnerability information. We believe that we have just scratched the surface and in the future, we plan to implant NLP with AI and ML to process even more public data from different regions, languages and sources that will increase coverage, accuracy and industries that are currently targeted by the system. To conclude, we will demonstrate that a system based on public data can accurately and in real-time curate, identify and prioritize high priority vulnerabilities to provide actionable insights.",

ByteSweep is a Free Software platform that automates a lot of the common steps I conduct manually when performing IoT pentests. ByteSweep utilizes the python libraries provides by binwalk to programatically extract filesystems from firmware images. In order to extract crypto keys and password hashes hard coded into firmware images, ByteSweep implements a custom strings regex search engine with configurable rules stored in a config file. Radare2's python r2pipe library is used to analyze extracted binaries for any unsafe function calls. (e.g. strcpy, sprintf, system, etc.) Version strings are extracted, using the strings regex search engine, from 3rd party components like open source programs and/or libraries. These version numbers are then compared against software version associated with CVEs by using the NVD JSON Data Feed. My talk will feature live demos of the ByteSweep platform but I'll pre-record them all in case of failure. ByteSweep Licensing: * Web Frontend: AGPLv3 * Backend Worker: GPLv3",
